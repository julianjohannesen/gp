I’d also picked up some organizing principles volunteering evenings after a day of H$R Block at a free tax clinic sponsored by Chelsea Fair Share. Fair Share’s leaders, Mark and Barbara Splain, taught me the value offering a service as part of earning trust and providing a chance to meet people who might join your cause. In their case an organization to build power among Chelsea’s low-income residents. It was a lesson I took with me for the rest of my career. \\n</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"philanthropy-years\\\">Philanthropy Years &ndash;&nbsp;Change not Charity</h2>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"the-haymarket-foundation\\\" style=\\\"margin-top: 32px\\\">\\n    The Haymarket Foundation and the Funding Exchange\\n</h3>\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"about-image floatright padding-1em\\\" style=\\\"width: 182px;\\\">\\n    <img\\n        alt=\\\"Leah Pillsbury\\\"\\n        height=\\\"277\\\"\\n        width=\\\"182\\\"\\n        src=\\\"../assets/img/leah-pillsbury-bread-and-roses.webp\\\"\\n        />\\n    <figcaption>My niece Leah Pillsbury carries the torch at the Philadelphia Fund, Bread and Roses.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<p>\\n    Having grown up more as a volunteer than a leader of campaigns, my first organizing project was the Haymarket People’s Fund. I started out with advice from local faith programs that made grants to community empowerment projects. Their unique approach included actively engaging members of the community in awarding the grants. At that time, I was studying for a master’s degree in American Studies at Goddard College. My final paper became a blueprint for creating a foundation. The Goddard course also inspired the its name, one that mixed the activist history I’d learned about the Haymarket Chicago protest for the eight-hour workday and Boston’s iconic 300-year-old Haymarket food market.\\n</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"about-image floatleft padding-1em\\\" style=\\\"width: 300px;\\\">\\n    <img\\n        alt=\\\"George with Janet Axelrod to his left\\\"\\n        height=\\\"212\\\"\\n        width=\\\"300\\\"\\n  src=\\\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/06/withJanetAxelrod.webp\\\"\\n        />\\n    <figcaption>At top David Crocker (left) and Linda Hillyer (right). At bottom Janet Axelrod (left) and George Pillsbury (right).</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<p>\\n    I followed the plan I created with my course instructor Steve Miller. First to explore how Boston foundations of the era worked, from the family foundations of the Cabot and Saltonstalls to the liberal churches and the social justice collaborative Resist. Then to meet with groups they suggested to explore the community organizing around Boston and eventually all of New England. All this became possible with my first hire, the wise and spirted Janet Axelrod and first full-time volunteer – my look alike twin to the outside world, David Crocker, assumed go to be heir to the “Betty Crocker” fortune, the made up brand of, Pillsbury’s competitor in the flour business.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Haymarket and the other alternative community funds that would form across the country sought to create a new generation of donors to support social change philanthropy. Under the banner of “Change not Charity,” we looked to invest in local organizations addressing the root causes of problems and taking steps towards more systemic and lasting solutions for the issues of the day. We hoped that our grants would give these local nonprofits the visibility and credibility that often results from association with the more established foundations. \\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Among those with inherited wealth that came of age in the social movements of the ’60s and ’70s, there was interest in funding those movements—but given the desire of many to remain anonymous, the challenge was to find them. I remembered the strategy of first offering a service, and found success in organizing gatherings for people with family wealth, providing a safe environment to discuss the personal issues related to coming into such wealth, including the impact on relationships, concerns about where their money came from, and how to have a conversation with their families or financial gatekeepers about using it to support activism.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Haymarket held its first local donor meetings in 1974 in partnership with the American Friends Service Committee. The Quaker network’s own donors had also asked for a personal retreat like this, with the assurances that the meeting would be private and free of fundraising. National gatherings began when our mentor, David Hunter of the Stern Family Fund, convened the donors he advised. Over time, the private meetings grew and would come to include activist leaders and guests who could offer their perspectives on social impact grantmaking. Through our formative years, we sponsored similar workshops and retreats—locally and nationally—that generated like-minded initiatives supporting a national trend towards social change grantmaking. \\n</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"about-image floatright padding-1em\\\" style=\\\"width: 400px;\\\">\\n    <img\\n        alt=\\\"Haymarket's founding board\\\"\\n        height=\\\"323\\\"\\n        width=\\\"400\\\"\\n        src=\\\"../assets/img/first-hpf-board.webp\\\"\\n        />\\n    <figcaption>The Haymarket People's Fund's founding Board:  (top) Rodolfo Rodriguez, Marjorie Bakken, Karen Nussbaum, Robert Zevin (bottom) Robert Read, Walter Porter, Lynn Rhodes</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<p>\\n    Along with the change in the types of grants came a shift in decision-making power. We broke from the private trustee model of grantmaking, where grants were approved by a board of family members or related legal and financial professionals, administered by a family office, opting instead for funding boards that would reflect the issues and communities where the grants were being made. It seemed more effective to have local leaders with grassroots organizing experience lead the process, and more in line with our values to have the process itself be an extension of community empowerment.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Haymarket’s founding board included activists like clerical worker Karen Nussbaum, who founded the organization 9to5, later made famous by the movie of the same name and Dolly Parton song; Walter Porter, Chair of the Boston association for minority firefighters; Robert Zevin, a lifelong activist and pioneer in the field of socially responsible investing; and Ann Froines, an advocate for women leaders. This model gave activists the opportunity to be grant makers Other public foundations with a similar mission soon adopted this approach.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n    <figure class=\\\"about-image floatleft padding-1em\\\" style=\\\"width: 250px;\\\">\\n        <img\\n            alt=\\\"Robin Hood was right\\\"\\n            height=\\\"300\\\"\\n            width=\\\"300\\\"\\n            src=\\\"../assets/img/robinhood300x300.webp\\\"\\n            />\\n        <figcaption>The cover of <i>Robin Hood Was Right</i></figcaption>\\n    </figure>\\n    <figure class=\\\"about-image floatright padding-1em\\\" style=\\\"width: 250px;\\\">\\n        <img\\n            alt=\\\"Robin Hood was right publicity shot\\\"\\n            height=\\\"250\\\"\\n            width=\\\"250\\\"\\n            src=\\\"../assets/img/gp-robin-hood-esquire.webp\\\"\\n            />\\n        <figcaption>\\n        </figcaption>\\n    </figure>\\n\\n    <p>\\n        In another break with traditional philanthropy, we went public. Because we were new and had to find new donors to join in our cause, we turned to marketing and outreach. In lieu of TV ads and the Internet, we gained recognition by having a presence at foundation gatherings, as well as publishing Robin Hood Was Right, inspired and edited by author Adam Hochschild. The book, published in 1977, featured our funds and attracted a national audience with appearances on the Oprah Winfrey and Phil Donahue shows and coverage from the New York Times to Parade magazine, Esquire, and The Wall Street Journal, and more.\\n\\n    </p>\\n    \\n    \\n    <figure class=\\\"about-image floatright padding-1em\\\" style=\\\"clear: right; width: 500px;\\\">\\n        <img\\n        alt=\\\"George on the Phil Donahue Show in 1978\\\"\\n        height=\\\"274\\\"\\n        width=\\\"600\\\"\\n        src=\\\"../assets/img/Donahue-Show-1978_cropped.webp\\\"\\n        />\\n        <figcaption>On Phil Donahue with Haymarket Donor Annie Hoffman</figcaption>\\n    </figure>\\n\\n\\n<p>\\n    In the wake of the publicity, young donors started 15 similar community foundations in areas like Atlanta, New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, and one in Los Angeles, Liberty Hill Foundation, founded by my sister Sarah Pillsbury. As we grew, it became clear that we would benefit from an association. Therefore, we created a national consortium called the Funding Exchange to support the growth of the local funds and to advance the conversation with other foundations around social change philanthropy.\\n</p>\\n<hr style=\\\"display:block; margin-bottom: 40px; text-align:center;\\\" />\\n<p>\\n    This is not the history of a single foundation.

In other words, a healthy and functioning democracy.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  In the 1990s, this trend was going in the wrong direction. Voter turnout\\n  hovered at historic lows. More than half of eligible voters didn’t vote in\\n  midterms, and even fewer voted in local elections.

The IRS never said that. The Treasury Department only said in a single\\n  sentence that 501c3 nonprofits, which most nonprofits are, cannot support or\\n  oppose candidates for public office. A sentence was added in the 1950s by then\\n  Senator Lyndon Johnson to protect educational and charitable 501c3 nonprofits\\n  from the quicksand of partisan politics, thus safeguarding the tax deductions\\n  for supporters and their ability to receive foundation and government grants.\\n  IRS guidance clearly stated that public 501c3 nonprofits may do any amount of\\n  voter registration and education, including helping people participate and\\n  vote, as long as they did so on a\\n  <a\\n    title=\\\"Nonpartisan Election Activities\\\"\\n    href=\\\"https://www.nonprofitvote.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/nonpartisan-election-activities-501c3-nonprofits-1.pdf\\\"\\n    >nonpartisan basis</a\\n  >.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  <figure class=\\\"about-image floatright padding-1em\\\" style=\\\"width: 400px\\\">\\n    <img\\n      alt=\\\"Staying Nonpartisan: Election Activities for Nonprofits\\\"\\n      height=\\\"48\\\"\\n      width=\\\"400\\\"\\n      src=\\\"../assets/img/501c3-Checklist.gif\\\"\\n    />\\n    <figcaption>Staying Nonpartisan Factsheet</figcaption>\\n  </figure>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The nonprofit sector had largely left untapped their inherent capacity — as\\n  trusted messengers, deeply rooted in their local communities — to increase\\n  voter participation among the people they served and engaged.

The coalition, originally set up to help\\n  progressive reform-oriented candidates run for office, added three nonpartisan\\n  programs: one challenging the role of money in state politics, one encouraging\\n  people to vote in local elections, and the other to support women’s political\\n  leadership. In 1993, I was recruited to run the money and politics program.\\n</p>\\n<figure class=\\\"about-image floatright padding-1em\\\" style=\\\"width: 175px\\\">\\n  <img\\n    alt=\\\"Malia Lazu at the Youth Summit in Washington D.C.\\\"\\n    height=\\\"305\\\"\\n    width=\\\"236\\\"\\n    src=\\\"../assets/img/malia-youth-summit.webp\\\"\\n  />\\n  <figcaption>Malia Lazu at the Youth Summit in Washington D.C.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>\\n  One of my first calls was from Emerson College student Malia Lazu, about her\\n  effort to hold a concert for democracy on Boston Common, the city’s downtown\\n  public park. Malia had heard about the concert I’d helped produce, headlined\\n  by Bob Marley, to benefit freedom movements in South Africa. When the city\\n  turned down her request for a permit because it feared problems with a\\n  multiracial audience, she volunteered to work for us at the coalition, and was\\n  soon directing the “Voter Power” initiative.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  We shared our disillusion with the state of politics, particularly its\\n  troubled history of racial bias. Too often, election outcomes were decided in\\n  primaries in districts designed to favor mostly white incumbents. On Election\\n  Day voters had few, if any, choices on the ballot, and too little reason to\\n  vote.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Malia and I met with Boston nonprofit and foundation leaders about a pilot\\n  program specifically focused on training nonprofits to integrate nonpartisan\\n  voter and civic participation into programs they already offered. We hoped\\n  that this civic venture would bring higher turnout and might encourage more\\n  candidates to run, despite the odds, resulting in more competitive elections.\\n</p>\\n<figure class=\\\"about-image floatleft padding-1em\\\" style=\\\"width: 200px\\\">\\n  <img\\n    alt=\\\"Boston VOTE\\\"\\n    height=\\\"237\\\"\\n    width=\\\"492\\\"\\n    src=\\\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/04/Boston-Vote-logo.webp\\\"\\n  />\\n</figure>\\n<p>\\n  Voter Power became Boston VOTE.

Each partner\\n    identified and managed a cohort of community-based nonprofits in their state\\n    to register voters and have them sign a pledge to vote onsite or at their\\n    events. They would track who registered and/or signed a pledge to vote. The\\n    data allowed us to measure our impact and learn lessons to share in our\\n    webinars and trainings.\\n</p>\\n<h5 id=\\\"national-partners\\\">National Partners</h5>\\n<p>\\n    Soon, our first national networks began to join, led by the\\n    <a href=\\\"https://www.alliance1.org/\\\" title=\\\"Alliance for Strong Families\\\"\\n        >Alliance for Strong Families and Communities</a>, a long-standing national\\n    network of settlement houses, neighborhood centers, human service agencies,\\n    and grassroots organizations focused on economic empowerment and\\n    neighborhood engagement. The second was the <a href=\\\"https://www.hcadvocacy.org/\\\"\\n      title=\\\"National Association of Community Health Centers\\\"  >National Association of Community Health Clinics</a>. Initiated by its advocacy\\n    director, Marc Wetherhorn. It established the Community Health Vote Program,\\n    with voter engagement resources and guidance shared with its 1,200 community\\n    health centers. They were followed by national partners like Goodwill\\n    Industries, Feeding America, and YWCA, all agreeing to incorporate voter\\n    engagement into their communications strategies and to promote our monthly\\n    webinars and online resources to their local and state affiliates.\\n    </a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Our national growth accelerated with the support of sector leaders like\\n    Tim Delaney and the\\n    <a href=\\\"https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/trends-policy-issues/protecting-nonprofit-nonpartisanship\\\" title=\\\"National Council of Nonprofits\\\"\\n        >National Council of Nonprofits</a>, which convened state associations in the 50\\n    states, and Diana Aviv and the advocacy team at the <a href=\\\"https://independentsector.org/\\\" title=\\\"Independent Sector\\\">Independent Sector (IS)</a>, with its membership of national nonprofit networks\\n    and foundations. It was at an IS conference that we met Steve Taylor, vice\\n    president of <a href=\\\"https://www.unitedway.org/\\\" title=\\\"United Way Worldwide\\\">United Way Worldwide</a>. He asked us to create a voter engagement toolkit\\n    tailored for local United Ways. Their director of advocacy and policy,\\n    Lindsay Torrico, joined our leadership council. Sector convenors like the\\n    <a>Council on Foundations</a> and the Regional Associations of Grantmakers (now\\n    called the <a>United Philanthropy Forum</a>) also joined. We saw the results, as\\n    more of their affiliates signed up for a webinar training, joined us on\\n    National Voter Registration Day, and invited us to present at their national\\n    conference.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <a href=\\\"https://www.nonprofitvote.org/about-national-partners/\\\" title=\\\"nonprofit vote\\\">\\n    National Partner list as of 2022\\n    </a>\\n</p>\\n<h5 id=\\\"election-officials\\\">Partnerships with Election Officials</h5>\\n<p>\\n    In 2009, we were invited by the\\n    <a href=\\\"https://www.nass.org/\\\" title=\\\"National Association of Secretaries of State\\\"\\n        >National Association of Secretaries of State</a> and soon after the <a href=\\\"https://www.nased.org/\\\" title=\\\"National Association of State Election Officials\\\"\\n        >National Association of State Election Directors</a> to be an official partner\\n    for the nonprofit sector. Their staff and members valued the nonpartisan\\n    guidance and training we gave nonprofits. We found our commitment to\\n    nonpartisanship opened doors, not just to the Secretaries of State, but to a\\n    wide variety of state and national partnerships and initiatives &ndash; the\\n    largest of which was National Voter Registration Day, and how we became one\\n    of the event&rsquo;s founders and its primary manager.\\n    </a>\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"NVRD\\\">National Voter Registration Day: A Celebration of Democracy</h4>\\n<p>\\n    In 2012, Nonprofit VOTE joined the leading nonpartisan voter registration\\n    organizations to establish National Voter Registration Day. Celebrated on the\\n    fourth Tuesday of every September, it quickly gained momentum as a nonpartisan\\n    civic holiday celebrating our democracy. Each year, organizations, volunteers,\\n    and local election offices &ldquo;hit the streets&rdquo;&mdash;online and in\\n    the field&mdash;in a single day of coordinated field, technology, and media\\n    efforts. Support for the day comes from the largest nonpartisan registration\\n    groups, including media companies like Google, Reddit, MTV, Tumblr, and\\n    Facebook, and thousands of grassroots community partners. In 2020, more than\\n    1.6 million voters registered or updated their registration on National Voter\\n    Registration Day. Along with the sponsors, 4,589 community partners signed up,\\n    recruiting 31,474 volunteers to conduct drives and stage events.\\n</p>\\n<p>Now National Voter Registration Day started.

The ban stems from a single sentence inserted into the tax code in\\n    1954 by then Senator Lyndon Johnson. Johnson did so\\n    <a\\n        href=\\\"https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/trends-policy-issues/protecting-nonprofit-nonpartisanship\\\" title=\\\"protecting nonprofit non-partisanship\\\"\\n        >to protect 501c3 nonprofits</a> from the quicksand of partisan politics, thus\\n    safeguarding the tax deductions allowed for donations to charitable and\\n    educational nonprofits for the long run. The IRS has repeatedly stated the\\n    ban did not exclude any non-partisan activity.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The trainings then highlighted the most common nonpartisan activities they\\n    could safely undertake, like voter registration, candidate forums, and\\n    reminders to vote. They also featured the benefits of voting for the nonprofit\\n    and the people they served, and offered strategies to help already busy\\n    organizations imagine how they could incorporate this work into their ongoing\\n    services, outreach, or events.\\n</p>\\n<h5 id=\\\"the-resources\\\">The Resources</h5>\\n<p>\\n    Perhaps my greatest contribution in my years at Nonprofit VOTE was creating\\n    the stock materials and resources that became the foundation of our guidance\\n    and partner trainings. I had guidance from leading experts in the field, most\\n    notably our attorney\\n    <a href=\\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-pomeranz-5719224/\\\" title=\\\"John Pomeranz\\\"\\n        >John Pomeranz</a>, and <a href=\\\"https://www.adlercolvin.com/gregory-l-colvin-2/\\\" title=\\\"Greg Colvin\\\"\\n        >Greg Colvin</a>, former co-chair of the <a href=\\\"https://www.americanbar.org/groups/taxation/committees_task_forces/exempt_orgs/\\\" title=\\\"American Bar Association Subcommittee\\n        on Political and Lobbying Activities of Exempt Organizations\\\">American Bar Association Subcommittee\\n    on Political and Lobbying Activities of Exempt Organizations</a>, as well as\\n    from the bolder advocacy program of the Alliance for Justice. Our online\\n    resources and monthly web trainings are accessed by nonprofits year round in\\n    all 50 states.\\n</p>\\n<h5 id=\\\"the-evaluation-of-impact\\\">\\n    The Evaluation of Impact: Measuring How Nonprofits Help People Vote\\n</h5>\\n<p>\\n    Every year, Nonprofit VOTE sees an increase in the number of nonprofits\\n    signing up for its trainings and voter engagement on site and in their\\n    community. A 2020 survey by the Urban Institute found that one in five of the\\n    nation&rsquo;s 875,000 registered nonprofits now do activities like voter\\n    registration and education.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But who are they reaching and is it helping increase voter participation? To\\n    find out, starting in 2012, Nonprofit VOTE enlisted a diverse set of state\\n    partners to manage a cohort of community-based nonprofits to track their voter\\n    engagement.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The participating nonprofits logged the people they registered to vote or who\\n    signed a voter pledge card and discussed their plan to vote. State voter files\\n    allowed us to do an independent analysis of the demographics and turnout rates\\n    of those we contacted to all other registered voters in the same area. The\\n    findings have consistently shown:\\n</p>\\n<ol>\\n    <li>\\n        <p>\\n            The people the nonprofits reach are disproportionately younger (ages\\n            18-25), lower income, and black, hispanic, or of color.\\n        </p>\\n    </li>\\n    <li>\\n        <p>\\n            The voter turnout for those we contacted varies from 5-15 points higher\\n            for the nonprofit voters, compared to all others. Nonprofits have had\\n            their largest impact on raising turnout in midterms.\\n        </p>\\n    </li>\\n    <li>\\n        <p>\\n            Turnout increases are highest among those least expected to vote, based on\\n            their demographics and voting history.\\n        </p>\\n    </li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>\\n    <em>See sample research. <a href=\\\"https://www.nonprofitvote.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/engaging-new-voters-2018.pdf\\\" title=\\\"Engaging New Voters 2018\\\">Engaging New Voters 2018</a></em>\\n</p>\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]],\"ghostVersion\":\"4.0\"}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>\n    After ending my first job out of college as a tax preparer for H&R Block, a call from my mother about a youth-run foundation to support activism in San Francisco sparked the idea of organizing my peers to try the same in Boston.\n</p>\n<p>\n    I had learned something about organizing from my activist mom who on most days could be found at her desk planning events or raising money for her favorite causes and candidates. I’d also picked up some organizing principles volunteering evenings after a day of H$R Block at a free tax clinic sponsored by Chelsea Fair Share. Fair Share’s leaders, Mark and Barbara Splain, taught me the value offering a service as part of earning trust and providing a chance to meet people who might join your cause. In their case an organization to build power among Chelsea’s low-income residents. It was a lesson I took with me for the rest of my career. \n</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"philanthropy-years\">Philanthropy Years &ndash;&nbsp;Change not Charity</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-haymarket-foundation\" style=\"margin-top: 32px\">\n    The Haymarket Foundation and the Funding Exchange\n</h3>\n\n<figure class=\"about-image floatright padding-1em\" style=\"width: 182px;\">\n    <img\n        alt=\"Leah Pillsbury\"\n        height=\"277\"\n        width=\"182\"\n        src=\"../assets/img/leah-pillsbury-bread-and-roses.webp\"\n        />\n    <figcaption>My niece Leah Pillsbury carries the torch at the Philadelphia Fund, Bread and Roses.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>\n    Having grown up more as a volunteer than a leader of campaigns, my first organizing project was the Haymarket People’s Fund. I started out with advice from local faith programs that made grants to community empowerment projects. Their unique approach included actively engaging members of the community in awarding the grants. At that time, I was studying for a master’s degree in American Studies at Goddard College. My final paper became a blueprint for creating a foundation. The Goddard course also inspired the its name, one that mixed the activist history I’d learned about the Haymarket Chicago protest for the eight-hour workday and Boston’s iconic 300-year-old Haymarket food market.\n</p>\n\n<figure class=\"about-image floatleft padding-1em\" style=\"width: 300px;\">\n    <img\n        alt=\"George with Janet Axelrod to his left\"\n        height=\"212\"\n        width=\"300\"\n  src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/06/withJanetAxelrod.webp\"\n        />\n    <figcaption>At top David Crocker (left) and Linda Hillyer (right). At bottom Janet Axelrod (left) and George Pillsbury (right).</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>\n    I followed the plan I created with my course instructor Steve Miller. First to explore how Boston foundations of the era worked, from the family foundations of the Cabot and Saltonstalls to the liberal churches and the social justice collaborative Resist. Then to meet with groups they suggested to explore the community organizing around Boston and eventually all of New England. All this became possible with my first hire, the wise and spirted Janet Axelrod and first full-time volunteer – my look alike twin to the outside world, David Crocker, assumed go to be heir to the “Betty Crocker” fortune, the made up brand of, Pillsbury’s competitor in the flour business.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Haymarket and the other alternative community funds that would form across the country sought to create a new generation of donors to support social change philanthropy. Under the banner of “Change not Charity,” we looked to invest in local organizations addressing the root causes of problems and taking steps towards more systemic and lasting solutions for the issues of the day. We hoped that our grants would give these local nonprofits the visibility and credibility that often results from association with the more established foundations. \n</p>\n<p>\n    Among those with inherited wealth that came of age in the social movements of the ’60s and ’70s, there was interest in funding those movements—but given the desire of many to remain anonymous, the challenge was to find them. I remembered the strategy of first offering a service, and found success in organizing gatherings for people with family wealth, providing a safe environment to discuss the personal issues related to coming into such wealth, including the impact on relationships, concerns about where their money came from, and how to have a conversation with their families or financial gatekeepers about using it to support activism.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Haymarket held its first local donor meetings in 1974 in partnership with the American Friends Service Committee. The Quaker network’s own donors had also asked for a personal retreat like this, with the assurances that the meeting would be private and free of fundraising. National gatherings began when our mentor, David Hunter of the Stern Family Fund, convened the donors he advised. Over time, the private meetings grew and would come to include activist leaders and guests who could offer their perspectives on social impact grantmaking. Through our formative years, we sponsored similar workshops and retreats—locally and nationally—that generated like-minded initiatives supporting a national trend towards social change grantmaking. \n</p>\n\n<figure class=\"about-image floatright padding-1em\" style=\"width: 400px;\">\n    <img\n        alt=\"Haymarket's founding board\"\n        height=\"323\"\n        width=\"400\"\n        src=\"../assets/img/first-hpf-board.webp\"\n        />\n    <figcaption>The Haymarket People's Fund's founding Board:  (top) Rodolfo Rodriguez, Marjorie Bakken, Karen Nussbaum, Robert Zevin (bottom) Robert Read, Walter Porter, Lynn Rhodes</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>\n    Along with the change in the types of grants came a shift in decision-making power. We broke from the private trustee model of grantmaking, where grants were approved by a board of family members or related legal and financial professionals, administered by a family office, opting instead for funding boards that would reflect the issues and communities where the grants were being made. It seemed more effective to have local leaders with grassroots organizing experience lead the process, and more in line with our values to have the process itself be an extension of community empowerment.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Haymarket’s founding board included activists like clerical worker Karen Nussbaum, who founded the organization 9to5, later made famous by the movie of the same name and Dolly Parton song; Walter Porter, Chair of the Boston association for minority firefighters; Robert Zevin, a lifelong activist and pioneer in the field of socially responsible investing; and Ann Froines, an advocate for women leaders. This model gave activists the opportunity to be grant makers Other public foundations with a similar mission soon adopted this approach.\n</p>\n\n\n\n    <figure class=\"about-image floatleft padding-1em\" style=\"width: 250px;\">\n        <img\n            alt=\"Robin Hood was right\"\n            height=\"300\"\n            width=\"300\"\n            src=\"../assets/img/robinhood300x300.webp\"\n            />\n        <figcaption>The cover of <i>Robin Hood Was Right</i></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <figure class=\"about-image floatright padding-1em\" style=\"width: 250px;\">\n        <img\n            alt=\"Robin Hood was right publicity shot\"\n            height=\"250\"\n            width=\"250\"\n            src=\"../assets/img/gp-robin-hood-esquire.webp\"\n            />\n        <figcaption>\n        </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <p>\n        In another break with traditional philanthropy, we went public. Because we were new and had to find new donors to join in our cause, we turned to marketing and outreach. In lieu of TV ads and the Internet, we gained recognition by having a presence at foundation gatherings, as well as publishing Robin Hood Was Right, inspired and edited by author Adam Hochschild. The book, published in 1977, featured our funds and attracted a national audience with appearances on the Oprah Winfrey and Phil Donahue shows and coverage from the New York Times to Parade magazine, Esquire, and The Wall Street Journal, and more.\n\n    </p>\n    \n    \n    <figure class=\"about-image floatright padding-1em\" style=\"clear: right; width: 500px;\">\n        <img\n        alt=\"George on the Phil Donahue Show in 1978\"\n        height=\"274\"\n        width=\"600\"\n        src=\"../assets/img/Donahue-Show-1978_cropped.webp\"\n        />\n        <figcaption>On Phil Donahue with Haymarket Donor Annie Hoffman</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n\n<p>\n    In the wake of the publicity, young donors started 15 similar community foundations in areas like Atlanta, New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, and one in Los Angeles, Liberty Hill Foundation, founded by my sister Sarah Pillsbury. As we grew, it became clear that we would benefit from an association. Therefore, we created a national consortium called the Funding Exchange to support the growth of the local funds and to advance the conversation with other foundations around social change philanthropy.\n</p>\n<hr style=\"display:block; margin-bottom: 40px; text-align:center;\" />\n<p>\n    This is not the history of a single foundation. It is the story of many similar efforts that built a movement to reshape philanthropy and create a community of foundations that shared a common social justice mission. Together we promoted the benefits of strategic grantmaking that sought to advance, over time, longer-term systemic approaches to the issues of the day.\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <figure class=\"about-image floatright padding-1em\" style=\"width: 200px;\">\n        <img\n            alt=\"Change Not Charity: The Story of the Funding Exchange\"\n            height=\"344\"\n            width=\"300\"\n            src=\"../assets/img/Funding_exchange_history.webp\"\n        />\n    <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n        <p>\n            For a history of the Funding Exchange, see the report\n            <a\n                title=\"Change, not Charity\"\n                href=\"https://philea.issuelab.org/resource/change-not-charity-the-story-of-the-funding-exchange-a-pioneer-in-social-justice-philanthropy.html\"\n                >Change, not Charity:&nbsp;A pioneer in social justice philanthropy</a\n                >.\n        </p>\n    </li>\n   \n</ul>\n\n<figure>\n    <blockquote>\n        Haymarket is part of a cooperative of alternative foundations such as ones operating in New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Los Angeles and the Pacific Northwest.

In other words, a healthy and functioning democracy.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In the 1990s, this trend was going in the wrong direction. Voter turnout\n  hovered at historic lows. More than half of eligible voters didn’t vote in\n  midterms, and even fewer voted in local elections. Most of the absent voters\n  were low-income, young, or first time voters new to the political process.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"about-image floatright\" style=\"width:300px\">\n  <img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/07/lowell.jpg\" alt=\"Voter registration at Community Health Center event, in Lowell, MA\" />\n    <figcaption>\n        Voter registration at Community Health Center event, in Lowell, MA\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\n  If the nonprofit sector wanted to strengthen democracy and have their voices\n  heard, one way was to help the people they served to vote.\n</p>\n<p>\n  However, at the time many nonprofits mistakenly believed that their charitable\n  status meant they couldn’t talk to their clients and constituents about\n  voting. The IRS never said that. The Treasury Department only said in a single\n  sentence that 501c3 nonprofits, which most nonprofits are, cannot support or\n  oppose candidates for public office. A sentence was added in the 1950s by then\n  Senator Lyndon Johnson to protect educational and charitable 501c3 nonprofits\n  from the quicksand of partisan politics, thus safeguarding the tax deductions\n  for supporters and their ability to receive foundation and government grants.\n  IRS guidance clearly stated that public 501c3 nonprofits may do any amount of\n  voter registration and education, including helping people participate and\n  vote, as long as they did so on a\n  <a\n    title=\"Nonpartisan Election Activities\"\n    href=\"https://www.nonprofitvote.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/nonpartisan-election-activities-501c3-nonprofits-1.pdf\"\n    >nonpartisan basis</a\n  >.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <figure class=\"about-image floatright padding-1em\" style=\"width: 400px\">\n    <img\n      alt=\"Staying Nonpartisan: Election Activities for Nonprofits\"\n      height=\"48\"\n      width=\"400\"\n      src=\"../assets/img/501c3-Checklist.gif\"\n    />\n    <figcaption>Staying Nonpartisan Factsheet</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</p>\n<p>\n  The nonprofit sector had largely left untapped their inherent capacity — as\n  trusted messengers, deeply rooted in their local communities — to increase\n  voter participation among the people they served and engaged.

The coalition, originally set up to help\n  progressive reform-oriented candidates run for office, added three nonpartisan\n  programs: one challenging the role of money in state politics, one encouraging\n  people to vote in local elections, and the other to support women’s political\n  leadership. In 1993, I was recruited to run the money and politics program.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"about-image floatright padding-1em\" style=\"width: 175px\">\n  <img\n    alt=\"Malia Lazu at the Youth Summit in Washington D.C.\"\n    height=\"305\"\n    width=\"236\"\n    src=\"../assets/img/malia-youth-summit.webp\"\n  />\n  <figcaption>Malia Lazu at the Youth Summit in Washington D.C.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\n  One of my first calls was from Emerson College student Malia Lazu, about her\n  effort to hold a concert for democracy on Boston Common, the city’s downtown\n  public park. Malia had heard about the concert I’d helped produce, headlined\n  by Bob Marley, to benefit freedom movements in South Africa. When the city\n  turned down her request for a permit because it feared problems with a\n  multiracial audience, she volunteered to work for us at the coalition, and was\n  soon directing the “Voter Power” initiative.\n</p>\n<p>\n  We shared our disillusion with the state of politics, particularly its\n  troubled history of racial bias. Too often, election outcomes were decided in\n  primaries in districts designed to favor mostly white incumbents. On Election\n  Day voters had few, if any, choices on the ballot, and too little reason to\n  vote.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Malia and I met with Boston nonprofit and foundation leaders about a pilot\n  program specifically focused on training nonprofits to integrate nonpartisan\n  voter and civic participation into programs they already offered.

We had recently decided to\n      purchase newly available redistricting software in order to monitor the\n      make-up of the new 2002 district lines which the legislature was about to\n      draw for Congress and themselves. We invited an attorney from the Lawyers\n      for Civil Rights Boston to help us discuss its impact on the Boston\n      neighborhoods where we were working. The story became one of racial\n      gerrymandering in Boston, a federal lawsuit by black voters, the\n      indictment and disbarment of the House speaker and, ultimately, justice\n      for the targeted communities.

As\n      a result, voters in a few neighborhoods determined the outcome of\n      most all municipal seats, who got hired for city jobs, and which\n      neighborhoods received services. In both cities, the plaintiffs we\n      represented won their case for fair elections.

The idea came from the Minnesota Council of\n    Nonprofits&rsquo; Marcia Avner and Jon Pratt, who had run a similar program\n    the year before. The timing worked well. At the same time, Catalina\n    Ruiz-Healy, of the San Francisco Tides Foundation, gave MassVOTE an\n    unsolicited grant of $50,000 to start similar initiatives in Oakland and other\n    states. A similar grant came from a donor at the Funding Exchange to support\n    nonprofit-led voter outreach in New Mexico and Pittsburgh.\n</p>\n<figure>\n    <blockquote>\n        When it Comes to Voting Rights, Philanthropy Needs to Act Like Every Day Is\n        Election Day\n    </blockquote>\n    <figcation class=\"attribution\">\n        <span rel=\"author\">\n        Geri Mannion,\n        </span>\n        <a\n            href=\"https://www.philanthropy.com/article/when-it-comes-to-voting-rights-philanthropy-needs-to-act-like-every-day-is-election-day\"\n            title=\"When it Comes to Voting Rights, Philanthropy Needs to Act Like Every Day Is Election Day\"\n            >\n        <time pubdate datetime=\"2021-04-01\"> April 2021 </time>\n        </a>\n    </figcation>\n</figure>\n<p>\n    What soon made it possible to reach out to the nonprofit sector nationally was\n    a $100,000 renewable grant from Geri Mannion, Managing Director of\n    Strengthening U.S. Democracy at the Carnegie Corporation foundation. Geri,\n    already a supporter of the MN Council of Nonprofits, had long wanted an\n    initiative to tap into what she saw as the &ldquo;sleeping giant&rdquo; of the\n    growing nonprofit sector to increase voter turnout among underrepresented\n    communities and strengthen democracy. She believed, as we did, that harnessing\n    the everyday contact that community-based nonprofits had with people less\n    likely to vote could increase their likelihood to vote and encourage their\n    family and friends to do the same.\n</p>\n<h4 id=\"activating\">Activating the Nonprofit Sector</h4>\n<p>\n    With offices in Minnesota and Boston, we reached out to other state\n    nonprofit convenors to see if they&rsquo;d join what we then called the\n    Nonprofit Voter Engagement Network or NVEN. At the same time, we started to\n    develop a strategy for what it would take to reach and engage a national\n    audience.\n</p>\n<h5 id=\"state-partners\">State Partners</h5>\n<p>\n    Nonprofit associations in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, Maine, and Louisiana\n    were among the first to join NVEN, followed by nonprofit networks in Arizona\n    and Greater Pittsburgh. Every year, NVEN members started meeting yearly in a\n    different state to hone our trainings and to strategize how we could grow the\n    network nationally. Among the most memorable was the 2008 meeting held in New\n    Orleans. We were inspired not only by the music and the city&rsquo;s ongoing\n    fight to recover from Hurricane Katrina, but by our irrepressible state host,\n    Ashley Herad of the Louisiana Alliance for Nonprofits who made us take a knee\n    at any hint of indecision to move forward\n</p>\n<p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.nonprofitvote.org/about-state-partners/\" title=\"state partner list\">State Partner list as of 2022</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    As more states joined, a geographically diverse subset of state partners\n    joined a field program to evaluate our approach and impact. Each partner\n    identified and managed a cohort of community-based nonprofits in their state\n    to register voters and have them sign a pledge to vote onsite or at their\n    events. They would track who registered and/or signed a pledge to vote. The\n    data allowed us to measure our impact and learn lessons to share in our\n    webinars and trainings.\n</p>\n<h5 id=\"national-partners\">National Partners</h5>\n<p>\n    Soon, our first national networks began to join, led by the\n    <a href=\"https://www.alliance1.org/\" title=\"Alliance for Strong Families\"\n        >Alliance for Strong Families and Communities</a>, a long-standing national\n    network of settlement houses, neighborhood centers, human service agencies,\n    and grassroots organizations focused on economic empowerment and\n    neighborhood engagement. The second was the <a href=\"https://www.hcadvocacy.org/\"\n      title=\"National Association of Community Health Centers\"  >National Association of Community Health Clinics</a>. Initiated by its advocacy\n    director, Marc Wetherhorn. It established the Community Health Vote Program,\n    with voter engagement resources and guidance shared with its 1,200 community\n    health centers. They were followed by national partners like Goodwill\n    Industries, Feeding America, and YWCA, all agreeing to incorporate voter\n    engagement into their communications strategies and to promote our monthly\n    webinars and online resources to their local and state affiliates.\n    </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Our national growth accelerated with the support of sector leaders like\n    Tim Delaney and the\n    <a href=\"https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/trends-policy-issues/protecting-nonprofit-nonpartisanship\" title=\"National Council of Nonprofits\"\n        >National Council of Nonprofits</a>, which convened state associations in the 50\n    states, and Diana Aviv and the advocacy team at the <a href=\"https://independentsector.org/\" title=\"Independent Sector\">Independent Sector (IS)</a>, with its membership of national nonprofit networks\n    and foundations. It was at an IS conference that we met Steve Taylor, vice\n    president of <a href=\"https://www.unitedway.org/\" title=\"United Way Worldwide\">United Way Worldwide</a>. He asked us to create a voter engagement toolkit\n    tailored for local United Ways. Their director of advocacy and policy,\n    Lindsay Torrico, joined our leadership council. Sector convenors like the\n    <a>Council on Foundations</a> and the Regional Associations of Grantmakers (now\n    called the <a>United Philanthropy Forum</a>) also joined. We saw the results, as\n    more of their affiliates signed up for a webinar training, joined us on\n    National Voter Registration Day, and invited us to present at their national\n    conference.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.nonprofitvote.org/about-national-partners/\" title=\"nonprofit vote\">\n    National Partner list as of 2022\n    </a>\n</p>\n<h5 id=\"election-officials\">Partnerships with Election Officials</h5>\n<p>\n    In 2009, we were invited by the\n    <a href=\"https://www.nass.org/\" title=\"National Association of Secretaries of State\"\n        >National Association of Secretaries of State</a> and soon after the <a href=\"https://www.nased.org/\" title=\"National Association of State Election Officials\"\n        >National Association of State Election Directors</a> to be an official partner\n    for the nonprofit sector. Their staff and members valued the nonpartisan\n    guidance and training we gave nonprofits. We found our commitment to\n    nonpartisanship opened doors, not just to the Secretaries of State, but to a\n    wide variety of state and national partnerships and initiatives &ndash; the\n    largest of which was National Voter Registration Day, and how we became one\n    of the event&rsquo;s founders and its primary manager.\n    </a>\n</p>\n<h4 id=\"NVRD\">National Voter Registration Day: A Celebration of Democracy</h4>\n<p>\n    In 2012, Nonprofit VOTE joined the leading nonpartisan voter registration\n    organizations to establish National Voter Registration Day. Celebrated on the\n    fourth Tuesday of every September, it quickly gained momentum as a nonpartisan\n    civic holiday celebrating our democracy. Each year, organizations, volunteers,\n    and local election offices &ldquo;hit the streets&rdquo;&mdash;online and in\n    the field&mdash;in a single day of coordinated field, technology, and media\n    efforts. Support for the day comes from the largest nonpartisan registration\n    groups, including media companies like Google, Reddit, MTV, Tumblr, and\n    Facebook, and thousands of grassroots community partners. In 2020, more than\n    1.6 million voters registered or updated their registration on National Voter\n    Registration Day. Along with the sponsors, 4,589 community partners signed up,\n    recruiting 31,474 volunteers to conduct drives and stage events.\n</p>\n<p>Now National Voter Registration Day started.

The ban stems from a single sentence inserted into the tax code in\n    1954 by then Senator Lyndon Johnson. Johnson did so\n    <a\n        href=\"https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/trends-policy-issues/protecting-nonprofit-nonpartisanship\" title=\"protecting nonprofit non-partisanship\"\n        >to protect 501c3 nonprofits</a> from the quicksand of partisan politics, thus\n    safeguarding the tax deductions allowed for donations to charitable and\n    educational nonprofits for the long run. The IRS has repeatedly stated the\n    ban did not exclude any non-partisan activity.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The trainings then highlighted the most common nonpartisan activities they\n    could safely undertake, like voter registration, candidate forums, and\n    reminders to vote. They also featured the benefits of voting for the nonprofit\n    and the people they served, and offered strategies to help already busy\n    organizations imagine how they could incorporate this work into their ongoing\n    services, outreach, or events.\n</p>\n<h5 id=\"the-resources\">The Resources</h5>\n<p>\n    Perhaps my greatest contribution in my years at Nonprofit VOTE was creating\n    the stock materials and resources that became the foundation of our guidance\n    and partner trainings. I had guidance from leading experts in the field, most\n    notably our attorney\n    <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-pomeranz-5719224/\" title=\"John Pomeranz\"\n        >John Pomeranz</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.adlercolvin.com/gregory-l-colvin-2/\" title=\"Greg Colvin\"\n        >Greg Colvin</a>, former co-chair of the <a href=\"https://www.americanbar.org/groups/taxation/committees_task_forces/exempt_orgs/\" title=\"American Bar Association Subcommittee\n        on Political and Lobbying Activities of Exempt Organizations\">American Bar Association Subcommittee\n    on Political and Lobbying Activities of Exempt Organizations</a>, as well as\n    from the bolder advocacy program of the Alliance for Justice. Our online\n    resources and monthly web trainings are accessed by nonprofits year round in\n    all 50 states.\n</p>\n<h5 id=\"the-evaluation-of-impact\">\n    The Evaluation of Impact: Measuring How Nonprofits Help People Vote\n</h5>\n<p>\n    Every year, Nonprofit VOTE sees an increase in the number of nonprofits\n    signing up for its trainings and voter engagement on site and in their\n    community. A 2020 survey by the Urban Institute found that one in five of the\n    nation&rsquo;s 875,000 registered nonprofits now do activities like voter\n    registration and education.\n</p>\n<p>\n    But who are they reaching and is it helping increase voter participation? To\n    find out, starting in 2012, Nonprofit VOTE enlisted a diverse set of state\n    partners to manage a cohort of community-based nonprofits to track their voter\n    engagement.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The participating nonprofits logged the people they registered to vote or who\n    signed a voter pledge card and discussed their plan to vote. State voter files\n    allowed us to do an independent analysis of the demographics and turnout rates\n    of those we contacted to all other registered voters in the same area.

I’d also picked up some organizing principles\nvolunteering evenings after a day of H$R Block at a free tax clinic sponsored by\nChelsea Fair Share. Fair Share’s leaders, Mark and Barbara Splain, taught me the\nvalue offering a service as part of earning trust and providing a chance to meet\npeople who might join your cause. In their case an organization to build power\namong Chelsea’s low-income residents. It was a lesson I took with me for the\nrest of my career.\n\nPhilanthropy Years – Change not Charity\nThe Haymarket Foundation and the Funding Exchange\nMy niece Leah Pillsbury carries the torch at the Philadelphia Fund, Bread and\nRoses.Having grown up more as a volunteer than a leader of campaigns, my first\norganizing project was the Haymarket People’s Fund. I started out with advice\nfrom local faith programs that made grants to community empowerment projects.\nTheir unique approach included actively engaging members of the community in\nawarding the grants. At that time, I was studying for a master’s degree in\nAmerican Studies at Goddard College. My final paper became a blueprint for\ncreating a foundation. The Goddard course also inspired the its name, one that\nmixed the activist history I’d learned about the Haymarket Chicago protest for\nthe eight-hour workday and Boston’s iconic 300-year-old Haymarket food market.\n\nAt top David Crocker (left) and Linda Hillyer (right). At bottom Janet Axelrod\n(left) and George Pillsbury (right).I followed the plan I created with my course\ninstructor Steve Miller. First to explore how Boston foundations of the era\nworked, from the family foundations of the Cabot and Saltonstalls to the liberal\nchurches and the social justice collaborative Resist. Then to meet with groups\nthey suggested to explore the community organizing around Boston and eventually\nall of New England. All this became possible with my first hire, the wise and\nspirted Janet Axelrod and first full-time volunteer – my look alike twin to the\noutside world, David Crocker, assumed go to be heir to the “Betty Crocker”\nfortune, the made up brand of, Pillsbury’s competitor in the flour business.\n\nHaymarket and the other alternative community funds that would form across the\ncountry sought to create a new generation of donors to support social change\nphilanthropy. Under the banner of “Change not Charity,” we looked to invest in\nlocal organizations addressing the root causes of problems and taking steps\ntowards more systemic and lasting solutions for the issues of the day. We hoped\nthat our grants would give these local nonprofits the visibility and credibility\nthat often results from association with the more established foundations.\n\nAmong those with inherited wealth that came of age in the social movements of\nthe ’60s and ’70s, there was interest in funding those movements—but given the\ndesire of many to remain anonymous, the challenge was to find them. I remembered\nthe strategy of first offering a service, and found success in organizing\ngatherings for people with family wealth, providing a safe environment to\ndiscuss the personal issues related to coming into such wealth, including the\nimpact on relationships, concerns about where their money came from, and how to\nhave a conversation with their families or financial gatekeepers about using it\nto support activism.\n\nHaymarket held its first local donor meetings in 1974 in partnership with the\nAmerican Friends Service Committee. The Quaker network’s own donors had also\nasked for a personal retreat like this, with the assurances that the meeting\nwould be private and free of fundraising. National gatherings began when our\nmentor, David Hunter of the Stern Family Fund, convened the donors he advised.\nOver time, the private meetings grew and would come to include activist leaders\nand guests who could offer their perspectives on social impact grantmaking.\nThrough our formative years, we sponsored similar workshops and retreats—locally\nand nationally—that generated like-minded initiatives supporting a national\ntrend towards social change grantmaking.\n\nThe Haymarket People's Fund's founding Board: (top) Rodolfo Rodriguez, Marjorie\nBakken, Karen Nussbaum, Robert Zevin (bottom) Robert Read, Walter Porter, Lynn\nRhodesAlong with the change in the types of grants came a shift in\ndecision-making power. We broke from the private trustee model of grantmaking,\nwhere grants were approved by a board of family members or related legal and\nfinancial professionals, administered by a family office, opting instead for\nfunding boards that would reflect the issues and communities where the grants\nwere being made. It seemed more effective to have local leaders with grassroots\norganizing experience lead the process, and more in line with our values to have\nthe process itself be an extension of community empowerment.\n\nHaymarket’s founding board included activists like clerical worker Karen\nNussbaum, who founded the organization 9to5, later made famous by the movie of\nthe same name and Dolly Parton song; Walter Porter, Chair of the Boston\nassociation for minority firefighters; Robert Zevin, a lifelong activist and\npioneer in the field of socially responsible investing; and Ann Froines, an\nadvocate for women leaders. This model gave activists the opportunity to be\ngrant makers Other public foundations with a similar mission soon adopted this\napproach.\n\nThe cover of Robin Hood Was Right In another break with traditional\nphilanthropy, we went public. Because we were new and had to find new donors to\njoin in our cause, we turned to marketing and outreach. In lieu of TV ads and\nthe Internet, we gained recognition by having a presence at foundation\ngatherings, as well as publishing Robin Hood Was Right, inspired and edited by\nauthor Adam Hochschild. The book, published in 1977, featured our funds and\nattracted a national audience with appearances on the Oprah Winfrey and Phil\nDonahue shows and coverage from the New York Times to Parade magazine, Esquire,\nand The Wall Street Journal, and more. \n\nOn Phil Donahue with Haymarket Donor Annie Hoffman In the wake of the publicity,\nyoung donors started 15 similar community foundations in areas like Atlanta, New\nYork, Chicago, Minneapolis, and one in Los Angeles, Liberty Hill Foundation,\nfounded by my sister Sarah Pillsbury. As we grew, it became clear that we would\nbenefit from an association. Therefore, we created a national consortium called\nthe Funding Exchange to support the growth of the local funds and to advance the\nconversation with other foundations around social change philanthropy.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is not the history of a single foundation. It is the story of many similar\nefforts that built a movement to reshape philanthropy and create a community of\nfoundations that shared a common social justice mission. Together we promoted\nthe benefits of strategic grantmaking that sought to advance, over time,\nlonger-term systemic approaches to the issues of the day.\n\n *  For a history of the Funding Exchange, see the report Change, not Charity: A\n   pioneer in social justice philanthropy\n   [https://philea.issuelab.org/resource/change-not-charity-the-story-of-the-funding-exchange-a-pioneer-in-social-justice-philanthropy.html]\n   . \n   \n   \n\n> Haymarket is part of a cooperative of alternative foundations such as ones\noperating in New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Los Angeles and the Pacific\nNorthwest. They are a vital source of support for groups addressing emerging\nsocial problems and for supporting community organizations that have active\ncitizen involvement. \n- The New York Times, 1979 Voter Engagement and Voting Rights\nAmong the foundations and nonprofits, I worked with, it was often said that\nthe resources they had were only a fraction of what government could\npotentially provide.\n\nThe long-term success of any nonprofit organization depended on a partnership\nwith a responsive government, both representative and accountable to the\ncommunities they served. In other words, a healthy and functioning democracy.\n\nIn the 1990s, this trend was going in the wrong direction. Voter turnout\nhovered at historic lows. More than half of eligible voters didn’t vote in\nmidterms, and even fewer voted in local elections. Most of the absent voters\nwere low-income, young, or first time voters new to the political process.\n\nVoter registration at Community Health Center event, in Lowell, MA If the\nnonprofit sector wanted to strengthen democracy and have their voices\nheard, one way was to help the people they served to vote.\n\nHowever, at the time many nonprofits mistakenly believed that their charitable\nstatus meant they couldn’t talk to their clients and constituents about\nvoting. The IRS never said that. The Treasury Department only said in a single\nsentence that 501c3 nonprofits, which most nonprofits are, cannot support or\noppose candidates for public office. A sentence was added in the 1950s by then\nSenator Lyndon Johnson to protect educational and charitable 501c3 nonprofits\nfrom the quicksand of partisan politics, thus safeguarding the tax deductions\nfor supporters and their ability to receive foundation and government grants.\nIRS guidance clearly stated that public 501c3 nonprofits may do any amount of\nvoter registration and education, including helping people participate and\nvote, as long as they did so on a nonpartisan basis\n[https://www.nonprofitvote.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/nonpartisan-election-activities-501c3-nonprofits-1.pdf]\n.\n\n Staying Nonpartisan Factsheet \n\nThe nonprofit sector had largely left untapped their inherent capacity — as\ntrusted messengers, deeply rooted in their local communities — to increase\nvoter participation among the people they served and engaged. They have\nday-to-day personal contact with potential voters often missed by candidates\nand campaigns more narrowly focused on attracting already likely voters.\nWhat’s more, their non-partisan approach tends to work better with new voters\nseeking help and information.\n\nBostonVOTE, MassVOTE\nAfter a mid-career year at the Harvard Kennedy School focused on electoral\nreform, I had my first chance to work at a democracy organization, the\nBoston-based Commonwealth Coalition. The coalition, originally set up to help\nprogressive reform-oriented candidates run for office, added three nonpartisan\nprograms: one challenging the role of money in state politics, one encouraging\npeople to vote in local elections, and the other to support women’s political\nleadership. In 1993, I was recruited to run the money and politics program.\n\nMalia Lazu at the Youth Summit in Washington D.C.One of my first calls was from\nEmerson College student Malia Lazu, about her\neffort to hold a concert for democracy on Boston Common, the city’s downtown\npublic park. Malia had heard about the concert I’d helped produce, headlined\nby Bob Marley, to benefit freedom movements in South Africa. When the city\nturned down her request for a permit because it feared problems with a\nmultiracial audience, she volunteered to work for us at the coalition, and was\nsoon directing the “Voter Power” initiative.\n\nWe shared our disillusion with the state of politics, particularly its\ntroubled history of racial bias. Too often, election outcomes were decided in\nprimaries in districts designed to favor mostly white incumbents. On Election\nDay voters had few, if any, choices on the ballot, and too little reason to\nvote.\n\nMalia and I met with Boston nonprofit and foundation leaders about a pilot\nprogram specifically focused on training nonprofits to integrate nonpartisan\nvoter and civic participation into programs they already offered. We hoped\nthat this civic venture would bring higher turnout and might encourage more\ncandidates to run, despite the odds, resulting in more competitive elections.\n\nVoter Power became Boston VOTE. Starting in Boston, we recruited a board of\nnonprofit leaders from the city’s lower turnout neighborhoods, including Kim\nJaney who, two decades later, would become the city’s first African-American\nand woman mayor — herself a reflection of a changing political landscape.\n\nBoston VOTE grew on the strength of its nonprofit outreach. By our second\nyear, we had signed up more than 120 nonprofits serving the low turnout\nneighborhoods, including Dorchester, Roxbury, Mattapan, and Allston/Brighton.\nBoston VOTE reached out to service providers, neighborhood development\norganizations, advocacy organizations, community health centers, and the like\nto offer our nonpartisan voter engagement training.\n\nWe made a special effort to engage youth through our own Young Civic Leaders\nprogram which offered paid internships for high school students to work with\nlocal nonprofits and scheduled time to learn about lawmaking at the state\nhouse and city hall.\n\nMany of these early partners developed their own voting initiatives,\nincluding:\n\n *   Dunk the Vote: A multi-faceted civic empowerment group\n   that had its start registering young black voters at youth basketball\n   competitions. They went on to partner with us on a voter registration\n   canvass called “Knock Across Boston.” \n   \n   \n *   Mass Council for Human Service Providers: A founding\n   partner, it had its own Care VOTE program to encourages human services\n   employees, clients, consumers, board members and friends to register and\n   vote. \n   \n   \n *   Chinese Progressive Association (CPA): CPA tripled\n   neighborhood turnout in its first city election. It became an advocate for\n   fair redistricting and translation for ballots and for city hall hearings\n   so all residents could fully participate. \n   \n   \n *   Codman Square Health Center: One of the first health\n   centers to participate in voter engagement. It used dedicated volunteers\n   and staff to offer voter registration on site and at community events. \n   \n   \n *   Madison Park Community Development Corporation: It hosted\n   Rox Vote, a coalition of Roxbury-based organizations to help residents\n   register and vote, host candidate forums, and promote youth civic\n   leadership. \n   \n   \n *   Mass Immigration and Refugee Advocacy Coalition: MIRA\n   registered new voters at citizenship ceremonies and supported civic\n   engagement and advocacy in partnership with its 130 organizational\n   members, many of which also worked with MassVOTE. \n   \n   \n *   Chelsea Human Services: An early partner, it organized\n   community canvasses to promote voting and recruited young poll workers.\n   Today the city’s large Latino population is fully represented on its city\n   council and school committee. \n   \n   \n *   Boston Election Department: We partnered on efforts to\n   provide voter education in lower turnout areas and eventually came to sit\n   on their community advisory board. \n   \n   \n\nA Civic Uprising\nMore Voters\nPercent increase in voters casting ballots compared to the same election 4\nyears before  *  Turnout rose in city and state elections for each of our first five years\n   in the 12 Boston neighborhoods with historically lowest voter\n   participation. \n   \n   \n *  Turnout growth averaged 30 percentage points compared to only 4% in the\n   neighborhoods with already higher turnout. \n   \n   \n\nMore Candidates\nFelix D. ArroyoAs turnout rose in the city’s more diverse neighborhoods, so did\nthe diversity\nof candidates. For the first time, in 2004 Boston elected a Latino candidate,\nFelix D. Arroyo, for a City Council at-large seat. The Boston Globe called it\n“an unprecedented leap in voting by minorities in Boston.”\n\nAndrea J. CabralThe next year, Cape Verdean candidate Andrea Cabral became\nBoston’s sheriff.\n“Coming on the heels of last year’s victory by city councilor Arroyo, it\nsignals a shifting landscape in Boston’s voting public. … a new era in Boston\npolitics.” –Boston Herald\n\nBoston VOTE Becomes MassVOTE\nAs interest grew in other cities such as Brockton, Lowell, Lawrence, and\nWorcester, we changed our name to MassVOTE and expanded our\nwork statewide on voting and voting rights.\n\nMassVOTE Staff 2004: Front (left to right): Treena Reney Bryant, Aitya\nDengleben, Back (left to right) George Pillsbury, Rose Arruda, Jeff Arp, Gibran\nRivera  * \n *   Civic Engagement Initiative: A collaboration, first with\n   Boston foundations, grew to make grants to nonprofits for voter outreach\n   in several metro areas in every region.

To address these issues, we joined with nonpartisan\n   organizations like the League of Women Voters, Common Cause, the Lawyers\n   for Civil Rights, and the Mass Public Interest Group to form what became\n   the Election Modernization Coalition.

We had recently decided\n   to\n   purchase newly available redistricting software in order to monitor the\n   make-up of the new 2002 district lines which the legislature was about to\n   draw for Congress and themselves. We invited an attorney from the Lawyers\n   for Civil Rights Boston to help us discuss its impact on the Boston\n   neighborhoods where we were working. The story became one of racial\n   gerrymandering in Boston, a federal lawsuit by black voters, the\n   indictment and disbarment of the House speaker and, ultimately, justice\n   for the targeted communities. (For the full story) \n   \n   \n *  \n *  We continued our collaboration with the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights\n   to challenge\n   biased voting methods in Springfield and Lowell. For decades their\n   winner-take-all, at-large voting method allowed a small group of white\n   voters to retain full control of the City Council and School Committee. As\n   a result, voters in a few neighborhoods determined the outcome of\n   most all municipal seats, who got hired for city jobs, and which\n   neighborhoods received services. In both cities, the plaintiffs we\n   represented won their case for fair elections.

The idea came from the Minnesota Council of\nNonprofits’ Marcia Avner and Jon Pratt, who had run a similar program\nthe year before. The timing worked well. At the same time, Catalina\nRuiz-Healy, of the San Francisco Tides Foundation, gave MassVOTE an\nunsolicited grant of $50,000 to start similar initiatives in Oakland and other\nstates. A similar grant came from a donor at the Funding Exchange to support\nnonprofit-led voter outreach in New Mexico and Pittsburgh.\n\n> When it Comes to Voting Rights, Philanthropy Needs to Act Like Every Day Is\nElection Day \nGeri Mannion, April 2021\n[https://www.philanthropy.com/article/when-it-comes-to-voting-rights-philanthropy-needs-to-act-like-every-day-is-election-day]\n What soon made it possible to reach out to the nonprofit sector nationally was\na $100,000 renewable grant from Geri Mannion, Managing Director of\nStrengthening U.S. Democracy at the Carnegie Corporation foundation. Geri,\nalready a supporter of the MN Council of Nonprofits, had long wanted an\ninitiative to tap into what she saw as the “sleeping giant” of the\ngrowing nonprofit sector to increase voter turnout among underrepresented\ncommunities and strengthen democracy. She believed, as we did, that harnessing\nthe everyday contact that community-based nonprofits had with people less\nlikely to vote could increase their likelihood to vote and encourage their\nfamily and friends to do the same.\n\nActivating the Nonprofit Sector\nWith offices in Minnesota and Boston, we reached out to other state\nnonprofit convenors to see if they’d join what we then called the\nNonprofit Voter Engagement Network or NVEN. At the same time, we started to\ndevelop a strategy for what it would take to reach and engage a national\naudience.\n\nState Partners\nNonprofit associations in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, Maine, and Louisiana\nwere among the first to join NVEN, followed by nonprofit networks in Arizona\nand Greater Pittsburgh. Every year, NVEN members started meeting yearly in a\ndifferent state to hone our trainings and to strategize how we could grow the\nnetwork nationally. Among the most memorable was the 2008 meeting held in New\nOrleans. We were inspired not only by the music and the city’s ongoing\nfight to recover from Hurricane Katrina, but by our irrepressible state host,\nAshley Herad of the Louisiana Alliance for Nonprofits who made us take a knee\nat any hint of indecision to move forward\n\n State Partner list as of 2022\n[https://www.nonprofitvote.org/about-state-partners/]\n\nAs more states joined, a geographically diverse subset of state partners\njoined a field program to evaluate our approach and impact. Each partner\nidentified and managed a cohort of community-based nonprofits in their state\nto register voters and have them sign a pledge to vote onsite or at their\nevents. They would track who registered and/or signed a pledge to vote. The\ndata allowed us to measure our impact and learn lessons to share in our\nwebinars and trainings.\n\nNational Partners\nSoon, our first national networks began to join, led by the Alliance for Strong\nFamilies and Communities [https://www.alliance1.org/], a long-standing national\nnetwork of settlement houses, neighborhood centers, human service agencies,\nand grassroots organizations focused on economic empowerment and\nneighborhood engagement. The second was the National Association of Community\nHealth Clinics [https://www.hcadvocacy.org/]. Initiated by its advocacy\ndirector, Marc Wetherhorn. It established the Community Health Vote Program,\nwith voter engagement resources and guidance shared with its 1,200 community\nhealth centers. They were followed by national partners like Goodwill\nIndustries, Feeding America, and YWCA, all agreeing to incorporate voter\nengagement into their communications strategies and to promote our monthly\nwebinars and online resources to their local and state affiliates.\n\nOur national growth accelerated with the support of sector leaders like\nTim Delaney and the National Council of Nonprofits\n[https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/trends-policy-issues/protecting-nonprofit-nonpartisanship]\n, which convened state associations in the 50\nstates, and Diana Aviv and the advocacy team at the Independent Sector (IS)\n[https://independentsector.org/], with its membership of national nonprofit\nnetworks\nand foundations. It was at an IS conference that we met Steve Taylor, vice\npresident of United Way Worldwide [https://www.unitedway.org/]. He asked us to\ncreate a voter engagement toolkit\ntailored for local United Ways. Their director of advocacy and policy,\nLindsay Torrico, joined our leadership council. Sector convenors like the \nCouncil on Foundations and the Regional Associations of Grantmakers (now\ncalled the United Philanthropy Forum) also joined. We saw the results, as\nmore of their affiliates signed up for a webinar training, joined us on\nNational Voter Registration Day, and invited us to present at their national\nconference.\n\n National Partner list as of 2022\n[https://www.nonprofitvote.org/about-national-partners/]\n\nPartnerships with Election Officials\nIn 2009, we were invited by the National Association of Secretaries of State\n[https://www.nass.org/] and soon after the National Association of State\nElection Directors [https://www.nased.org/] to be an official partner\nfor the nonprofit sector. Their staff and members valued the nonpartisan\nguidance and training we gave nonprofits. We found our commitment to\nnonpartisanship opened doors, not just to the Secretaries of State, but to a\nwide variety of state and national partnerships and initiatives – the\nlargest of which was National Voter Registration Day, and how we became one\nof the event’s founders and its primary manager.\n\nNational Voter Registration Day: A Celebration of Democracy\nIn 2012, Nonprofit VOTE joined the leading nonpartisan voter registration\norganizations to establish National Voter Registration Day. Celebrated on the\nfourth Tuesday of every September, it quickly gained momentum as a nonpartisan\ncivic holiday celebrating our democracy. Each year, organizations, volunteers,\nand local election offices “hit the streets”—online and in\nthe field—in a single day of coordinated field, technology, and media\nefforts. Support for the day comes from the largest nonpartisan registration\ngroups, including media companies like Google, Reddit, MTV, Tumblr, and\nFacebook, and thousands of grassroots community partners. In 2020, more than\n1.6 million voters registered or updated their registration on National Voter\nRegistration Day. Along with the sponsors, 4,589 community partners signed up,\nrecruiting 31,474 volunteers to conduct drives and stage events.\n\nNow National Voter Registration Day started. (Insert Link here)\n\nTrainings and Resources\nThe Trainings\nWhen we began, nonprofits mainly knew what they couldn’t do around elections,\nbut had little knowledge of what\nthey could do on a nonpartisan basis to help people vote and educate\ncandidates on their issues.\n\n> A 501(c)(3 tax-exempt organization may not intervene in any political\ncampaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public\noffice. \nblah blah Our basic trainings explained the ban on partisan activities and when\nand how\nit started. The ban stems from a single sentence inserted into the tax code in\n1954 by then Senator Lyndon Johnson. Johnson did so to protect 501c3 nonprofits\n[https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/trends-policy-issues/protecting-nonprofit-nonpartisanship] \nfrom the quicksand of partisan politics, thus\nsafeguarding the tax deductions allowed for donations to charitable and\neducational nonprofits for the long run. The IRS has repeatedly stated the\nban did not exclude any non-partisan activity.\n\nThe trainings then highlighted the most common nonpartisan activities they\ncould safely undertake, like voter registration, candidate forums, and\nreminders to vote. They also featured the benefits of voting for the nonprofit\nand the people they served, and offered strategies to help already busy\norganizations imagine how they could incorporate this work into their ongoing\nservices, outreach, or events.\n\nThe Resources\nPerhaps my greatest contribution in my years at Nonprofit VOTE was creating\nthe stock materials and resources that became the foundation of our guidance\nand partner trainings. I had guidance from leading experts in the field, most\nnotably our attorney John Pomeranz\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-pomeranz-5719224/], and Greg Colvin\n[https://www.adlercolvin.com/gregory-l-colvin-2/], former co-chair of the \nAmerican Bar Association Subcommittee\non Political and Lobbying Activities of Exempt Organizations\n[https://www.americanbar.org/groups/taxation/committees_task_forces/exempt_orgs/]\n, as well as\nfrom the bolder advocacy program of the Alliance for Justice. Our online\nresources and monthly web trainings are accessed by nonprofits year round in\nall 50 states.\n\nThe Evaluation of Impact: Measuring How Nonprofits Help People Vote\nEvery year, Nonprofit VOTE sees an increase in the number of nonprofits\nsigning up for its trainings and voter engagement on site and in their\ncommunity. A 2020 survey by the Urban Institute found that one in five of the\nnation’s 875,000 registered nonprofits now do activities like voter\nregistration and education.\n\nBut who are they reaching and is it helping increase voter participation? To\nfind out, starting in 2012, Nonprofit VOTE enlisted a diverse set of state\npartners to manage a cohort of community-based nonprofits to track their voter\nengagement.\n\nThe participating nonprofits logged the people they registered to vote or who\nsigned a voter pledge card and discussed their plan to vote. State voter files\nallowed us to do an independent analysis of the demographics and turnout rates\nof those we contacted to all other registered voters in the same area. The\nfindings have consistently shown:\n\n 1.  The people the nonprofits reach are disproportionately younger (ages\n    18-25), lower income, and black, hispanic, or of color. \n    \n    \n 2.  The voter turnout for those we contacted varies from 5-15 points higher\n    for the nonprofit voters, compared to all others.

Pillsbury and his uncle, John S. Pillsbury. John was the first to leave the family homestead of Sutton, New Hampshire in search of new opportunities. In 1855, John first traveled to San Francisco, then backtracked to visit the settlement of Saint Anthony Falls along the Mississippi because it reminded him of the Merrimack River he had left behind in New England. He found opportunity in establishing a hardware store and later a flour mill in what would become Minneapolis.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n    Once the hardware store was up and running, he encouraged my grandfather Charles, who had studied the mills of Montreal, to join him. His nephew's assignment was to start and manage what became the first Pillsbury mill. Overcoming any number of challenges, from fires to finance, Charles always gave priority to investing in the health and education of the company’s employees. The fledgling enterprise found its way. What was originally the A-Mill is still marked by its landmark neon sign on the skyline of Minneapolis.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n    Growing up with this legacy, there was no way I could hide from the brand and all that came with it. This became more true when the Pillsbury company adopted the <a href=\\\"https://www.pillsbury.com/doughboy\\\">Dough Boy</a> as its mascot, which left me with more than my share of \\\"Are you related?\\\" at the check-out counter and Dough Boy pokes and jokes. </p>\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"about-image about-image--small floatleft\\\">\\n    <img alt=\\\"Pillsbury Doughboy\\\" src=\\\"../assets/img/doughboy150x248.webp\\\"  width=\\\"150\\\" height=\\\"248\\\"/>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<p>\\n    Along with my family’s eventual success in Minnesota came the expectation of civic and community engagement, built on the values they brought with them from their life in New Hampshire and ancestors before. Values I was taught by my family and carried into my career in philanthropy and voter engagement - starting with a grant-making foundation for people of my generation to support social action and community organizing of the era. It was no surprise my ventures into philanthropy soon came with the nickname the “Dough Boy.”</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"about-image floatright\\\">\\n    <img class=\\\"class-name\\\" src=\\\"../assets/img/georgesallycampaign300x188.webp\\\"   width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"188\\\" alt=\\\"Sally and George campaign in Independence, MN\\\" />\\n<figcaption>Sally and George campaign in Independence, MN</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<p>\\n    My other brand was my parents, George and Sally Pillsbury. In their 56-year marriage as political and civic activists, they were hard to miss at any venue or gathering for community service or on the campaign trail. Except for two years in New York, they lived in and devoted their whole 90+ years to Minnesota.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n    My father (<a href=\\\"https://www.startribune.com/obituaries/detail/13635262/\\\">1922-2012</a>), was born in his parents’ house west of Minneapolis on Lake Minnetonka. A graduate of Yale University and a U.S. Marine, he was the last in the family to work for the Pillsbury company, later serving 12 years in the Minnesota State Senate.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n    My mother (<a href=\\\"https://www.startribune.com/obituaries/detail/0000242819/\\\">1924-2018</a>), grew up in St. Cloud, a small city northwest of the Twin Cities. Having moved with her family to Lake Minnetonka not far from my father, she graduated Smith College and made a name for herself in community service and politics.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n    They both strived at every opportunity to promote the moderate Lincoln wing of the Republican party and its values. My father, well into his 80s at the time, was <a href=\\\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2010/12/04/republican-central-committee\\\">banned</a> by the state party for supporting an Independent candidate.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"early-years\\\">Early years</h2>\\n\\n<p>\\n    My first memory of politics was joining my mother at the 1958 Minnesota Republican convention where teen entertainment was a hula hoop contest. Embarrassing but fun. It was the start of a steady flow of state and county conventions and campaigns run out of our basement or featured at the political booths of the state fair.</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"about-image about-image--med floatright\\\">\\n    \\n    <img src=\\\"../assets/img/64convention150x150.webp\\\"   width=\\\"150\\\" height=\\\"150\\\" alt=\\\"1964 GOP Convention, San Francisco\\\" />\\n    <figcaption>1964 GOP Convention, San Francisco</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<p>\\n    I joined her at the 1964 GOP national convention in San Francisco on behalf of moderate Pennsylvania Governor Bill Scranton against Barry Goldwater. At the time, His campaign helped move the far right to <a href=\\\"https://www.history.com/news/barry-goldwater-1964-campaign-right-wing-republican\\\" title=\\\"Goldwater campaign\\\">center stage</a>. Then in 1968, in the wake of the explosive protests at Chicago's Democratic Convention, I went with a youth to Miami to support New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller against Richard Nixon. The busload of young Republicans included my sister Sarah. In distress of the party's choice, on our bus ride home our youth group issued a press release picked up (to our parents’ surprise) by the local papers endorsing the Democratic nominee, Senator Hubert Humphrey (MN).</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n    I still had opportunities to work for Republican moderates. I wasn’t at home with either major party.

This changed as I watched the issues of race and war tear the country apart. When I moved to live in the diverse working-class city of New Haven to enter college at Yale, I was drawn to life outside campus. More engaged by the community service work of the New Haven Black Panthers, and the anti-war protests. I didn't give up contesting elections, joining my brother to canvass for the peace campaign of New York's Al Lowenstein. I signed onto join the reform mayoral campaign to unseat New Haven's party machine.</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"about-image floatright\\\">\\n   \\n    <img class=\\\"class-name\\\" src=\\\"../assets/img/kidslunch300x379.webp\\\"   width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"379\\\" alt=\\\"Free breakfast program offered by the Black Panther\\\" />\\n    <figcaption>Free breakfast program offered by the Black Panthers</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<p>\\n    At the same time, I made my first ever political donation. In a short-lived attempt at anonymity, I left $200 in cash at the office at the office of the Black Panthers for their free breakfast, health, and community education programs. I let them have my car to help residents visit family members in prison. This side of my volunteer work earned me a substantial FBI file informed by the New Haven police tapping my dorm room phone. A few years later a letter arrived with a $1,000 check from a class action suit I signed onto against the New Haven PD.</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"about-image floatleft\\\">\\n    \\n    <img src=\\\"../assets/img/yaleneedswomen228x321.jpg\\\"   width=\\\"228\\\" height=\\\"321\\\" alt=\\\"Women break a 265-year gender barrier\\\" />\\n    <figcaption>Women break a 265-year gender barrier</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<p>\\n    I had some memorable college classes, but maybe because of the family I grew up with, I learned the most from what happened outside them. My friendship with the Panther leaders taught me lessons in personal relations across different backgrounds.  As did two weeks on a picket line with the dining hall and janitorial workers. Yale going co-ed in my sophomore year (I'd been at boys' schools since 3rd grade), brought a new connection and appreciation of strong women like my mother and two sisters. In 1969 outnumbered by eight to one, 455 women brought feminism to campus, interrupting a men's club of 265 years.</p>\\n    \\n<h3 id=\\\"haymarket-foundation\\\">Haymarket Foundation</h3>\\n\\n<p>\\n    My first job after college was doing a season of tax preparation for H&R Block. I had graduated a semester late, and had taken their tax prep course in the fall so I would have a job in January when I moved northeast to Cambridge. In my Central Square office, I had a chance to learn the ins and outs of deductions and help area residents like presidential biographer <a href=\\\"https://doriskearnsgoodwin.com/\\\">Doris Kearns Goodwin</a> and future author, <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Klein\\\">Joe Klein</a>, then a columnist for city's alternative weekly, <em>The Real Paper</em>. In the evenings I volunteered at a free tax clinic for low-income residents sponsored by Fair Share, a community group in neighboring Chelsea.</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>\\n    In 1972, As the tax season wound down and I wondered what was next, I got a timely call from my mother. She had just met someone my age at the national meeting of the Council of Foundations, held that year in Minneapolis. As was her nature, she introduced herself to the youngest person there, the one with the pony tail and sneakers. Obie Benz, a Sunbeam Bread heir, had started the Vanguard Foundation in San Francisco as a way for young people with inherited wealth to support social change initiatives in the Bay area. Urged on by my college friend, Lynn Rosengarten, I decided to give it a try in Boston. We traveled west to meet Obie and Vanguard volunteer Anne Hess. Annie had experience from a family foundation, the Stern Family Fund. At the time, it was one of the few national foundations to focus on supporting activism. Its director <a href=\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/30/nyregion/david-hunter-84-innovator-in-matching-philanthropies.html\\\">David Hunter</a> would be invaluable in helping us get started.</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"about-image floatleft\\\">\\n    \\n    <img src=\\\"../assets/img/sallyvisits300x300.jpg\\\"   width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" alt=\\\"My mother visits our office\\\" />\\n    <figcaption>My mother visits our office</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<p>\\n    New to Boston and with less money than people expected from my last name, I had to find others like myself to join in. In time they did, and the Haymarket Foundation started at 2 Holyoke Street in Harvard Square. It offered an opportunity for young donors in New England to support organizing and community empowerment. Empowerment included sharing the power to make grants with experienced local leaders. Haymarket also gave its donors, many of whom remained anonymous, a chance to meet with others like themselves to discuss personal issues related to inherited wealth and living out the values that drew them to Haymarket in the first place.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"funding-exchange\\\">Funding Exchange</h3>\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"about-image floatright\\\">\\n    <img alt=\\\"Robin Hood Was Right Book cover by Barbara Garzer, 1977\\\" src=\\\"../assets/img/robinhood300x300.webp\\\"   width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" />\\n    <figcaption>Book cover by Barbara Garzer, 1977</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<p>\\n    We first reached a national audience with the publication of our book, <a href=\\\"https://www.abebooks.com/9780960197415/Robin-Hood-right-guide-giving-0960197419/plp\\\"><em>Robin Hood Was Right</em></a>, a gift-giving guide to funding social change. Talk show hosts Phil Donahue and Oprah Winfrey invited us on to talk about the book, and, in a friendly way, ask questions like why we were supporting causes that could well reduce our wealth advantage.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n    In the wake of the publicity, young donors started similar community foundations in Atlanta, New York, Chicago, Minneapolis and elsewhere. We created a national consortium called the Funding Exchange to support their growth and, as a national network engage other foundations in a conversation about social change philanthropy and the value of more diversity to their boards.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"the-film-fund\\\">The Film Fund</h3>\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"about-image about-image--med floatleft\\\">\\n    <img alt=\\\"Poster for 1976 Oscar winning documentary Harlan County, USA.

In response, my Haymarket co-founder David Crocker and I joined producer Miles Mogulescu to create The Film Fund, as a vehicle to support and give visibility to social issue documentaries such as ones we'd invested in individually: 1976 Oscar-winning, <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_County,_USA\\\">Harlan County USA</a> and 1977 Oscar nominee <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Maids\\\">Union Maids</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\n    We recruited a panel of experienced filmmakers including Barbara Kopple and Julia Reichert, the directors of the above films, and renowned cinematographer Haskell Wexler to evaluate promising documentaries already in production and in need of a boost or finishing costs. The Film Fund had a ten-year life, contributing with others to the emergence of the independent documentary film landscape we see today.</p>\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n<p>\\n    By the 1990s, the nonprofit and philanthropic sector had grown exponentially. Many more traditional community and private foundations, as well as new ones similar to ours, had incorporated a more systemic approach to addressing social issues through advocacy and community building. At the same time, it became more evident that progress on any issue depended on a democracy and government that worked and had the trust and participation of its citizens. That brought me back to my family roots in good government and elections.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n    In 1994, a mid-career year program at the Harvard Kennedy School gave me an opportunity to explore best practices for elections among the states and in countries similar to ours. On graduation, I took a job with the Commonwealth Coalition, a network of advocacy groups working to elect reform candidates to the state legislature. The Commonwealth Coalition also had two democracy programs. The Money and Politics, which I was hired to direct, and Voter Power, where I joined Malia Lazu to start Boston Vote.</p>\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"boston-vote-massvote\\\">Boston Vote &ndash; MassVOTE</h3>\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"about-image floatright\\\">\\n    <img alt=\\\"MassVOTE logo\\\" src=\\\"../assets/img/massvote300x99.webp\\\"   width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"99\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\n<p>\\n    As voter turnout in Boston hit rock bottom, local nonprofit leaders approached us to see if their community-based organizations could get the people they served every day to register and vote. As long as voter participation in their neighborhoods remained low, they'd continue to be overlooked by campaigns and elected officials.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n    Together we started Boston Vote to train nonprofits on what they could do on a non-partisan basis to encourage voting and better understand its broader benefits to their mission and people they served. Boston Vote, which became MassVOTE, also worked with local election officers and state officials to improve voter access and education. Along the way it won some key voting rights victories, including an effort that led to the high-profile resignation of a House Speaker who tried to gerrymander Boston's black community and dilute their vote.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"nonprofit-vote\\\">Nonprofit VOTE</h3>\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"about-image floatright\\\">\\n    <img alt=\\\"NonprofitVOTE logo\\\" src=\\\"../assets/img/nonprofitvote300x48.jpg\\\"  width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"48\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\n<p>\\n    In 2004, we discovered that the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits ran a program similar to MassVOTE. Its advocacy director, Marcia Avner, contacted us about a collaboration to share our models with other states. Nonprofit associations in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, Louisiana, and Maine were some of the earliest to join what would become Nonprofit VOTE. With the help of the National Council of Nonprofits, it initially focused on training and resourcing other state nonprofit conveners to make voter engagement part of their programing.</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>\\n    Through its website, communications, and national partnerships, it reached a 50-state audience for its nonpartisan resources and trainings to help nonprofits integrate voter engagement into their ongoing activities and services.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n    Some of the early national partnerships were with nonprofit convenors like the National Council of Nonprofits, Independent Sector, and United Way, and networks like the National Association of Community Health Centers, Goodwill Industries, Feeding America, and  <a href=\\\"https://www.alliance1.org/web/about/web/about-us.aspx\\\">Alliance for Strong Families and Communities</a>.</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"about-image about-image--med floatleft\\\" >\\n    <img alt=\\\"NVRD logo\\\" src=\\\"../assets/img/nvrd242x249.png\\\"  width=\\\"242\\\" height=\\\"249\\\"  />\\n</figure>\\n\\n<p>\\n    Nonprofit VOTE soon became the official partner for the nonprofit sector for the National Association of Secretaries of State.

Pillsbury and his uncle, John S. Pillsbury. John was the first to leave the family homestead of Sutton, New Hampshire in search of new opportunities. In 1855, John first traveled to San Francisco, then backtracked to visit the settlement of Saint Anthony Falls along the Mississippi because it reminded him of the Merrimack River he had left behind in New England. He found opportunity in establishing a hardware store and later a flour mill in what would become Minneapolis.</p>\n\n<p>\n    Once the hardware store was up and running, he encouraged my grandfather Charles, who had studied the mills of Montreal, to join him. His nephew's assignment was to start and manage what became the first Pillsbury mill. Overcoming any number of challenges, from fires to finance, Charles always gave priority to investing in the health and education of the company’s employees. The fledgling enterprise found its way. What was originally the A-Mill is still marked by its landmark neon sign on the skyline of Minneapolis.</p>\n\n<p>\n    Growing up with this legacy, there was no way I could hide from the brand and all that came with it. This became more true when the Pillsbury company adopted the <a href=\"https://www.pillsbury.com/doughboy\">Dough Boy</a> as its mascot, which left me with more than my share of \"Are you related?\" at the check-out counter and Dough Boy pokes and jokes. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"about-image about-image--small floatleft\">\n    <img alt=\"Pillsbury Doughboy\" src=\"../assets/img/doughboy150x248.webp\"  width=\"150\" height=\"248\"/>\n</figure>\n\n<p>\n    Along with my family’s eventual success in Minnesota came the expectation of civic and community engagement, built on the values they brought with them from their life in New Hampshire and ancestors before. Values I was taught by my family and carried into my career in philanthropy and voter engagement - starting with a grant-making foundation for people of my generation to support social action and community organizing of the era. It was no surprise my ventures into philanthropy soon came with the nickname the “Dough Boy.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"about-image floatright\">\n    <img class=\"class-name\" src=\"../assets/img/georgesallycampaign300x188.webp\"   width=\"300\" height=\"188\" alt=\"Sally and George campaign in Independence, MN\" />\n<figcaption>Sally and George campaign in Independence, MN</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>\n    My other brand was my parents, George and Sally Pillsbury. In their 56-year marriage as political and civic activists, they were hard to miss at any venue or gathering for community service or on the campaign trail. Except for two years in New York, they lived in and devoted their whole 90+ years to Minnesota.</p>\n\n<p>\n    My father (<a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/obituaries/detail/13635262/\">1922-2012</a>), was born in his parents’ house west of Minneapolis on Lake Minnetonka. A graduate of Yale University and a U.S. Marine, he was the last in the family to work for the Pillsbury company, later serving 12 years in the Minnesota State Senate.</p>\n\n<p>\n    My mother (<a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/obituaries/detail/0000242819/\">1924-2018</a>), grew up in St. Cloud, a small city northwest of the Twin Cities. Having moved with her family to Lake Minnetonka not far from my father, she graduated Smith College and made a name for herself in community service and politics.</p>\n\n<p>\n    They both strived at every opportunity to promote the moderate Lincoln wing of the Republican party and its values. My father, well into his 80s at the time, was <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2010/12/04/republican-central-committee\">banned</a> by the state party for supporting an Independent candidate.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"early-years\">Early years</h2>\n\n<p>\n    My first memory of politics was joining my mother at the 1958 Minnesota Republican convention where teen entertainment was a hula hoop contest. Embarrassing but fun. It was the start of a steady flow of state and county conventions and campaigns run out of our basement or featured at the political booths of the state fair.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"about-image about-image--med floatright\">\n    \n    <img src=\"../assets/img/64convention150x150.webp\"   width=\"150\" height=\"150\" alt=\"1964 GOP Convention, San Francisco\" />\n    <figcaption>1964 GOP Convention, San Francisco</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>\n    I joined her at the 1964 GOP national convention in San Francisco on behalf of moderate Pennsylvania Governor Bill Scranton against Barry Goldwater.

Then in 1968, in the wake of the explosive protests at Chicago's Democratic Convention, I went with a youth to Miami to support New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller against Richard Nixon. The busload of young Republicans included my sister Sarah. In distress of the party's choice, on our bus ride home our youth group issued a press release picked up (to our parents’ surprise) by the local papers endorsing the Democratic nominee, Senator Hubert Humphrey (MN).</p>\n\n<p>\n    I still had opportunities to work for Republican moderates.

Pillsbury. John was the first to leave the\nfamily homestead of Sutton, New Hampshire in search of new opportunities. In\n1855, John first traveled to San Francisco, then backtracked to visit the\nsettlement of Saint Anthony Falls along the Mississippi because it reminded him\nof the Merrimack River he had left behind in New England. He found opportunity\nin establishing a hardware store and later a flour mill in what would become\nMinneapolis.\n\nOnce the hardware store was up and running, he encouraged my grandfather\nCharles, who had studied the mills of Montreal, to join him. His nephew's\nassignment was to start and manage what became the first Pillsbury mill.\nOvercoming any number of challenges, from fires to finance, Charles always gave\npriority to investing in the health and education of the company’s employees.\nThe fledgling enterprise found its way. What was originally the A-Mill is still\nmarked by its landmark neon sign on the skyline of Minneapolis.\n\nGrowing up with this legacy, there was no way I could hide from the brand and\nall that came with it. This became more true when the Pillsbury company adopted\ntheDough Boy [https://www.pillsbury.com/doughboy]as its mascot, which left me\nwith more than my share of \"Are you related?\" at the check-out counter and Dough\nBoy pokes and jokes. \n\nAlong with my family’s eventual success in Minnesota came the expectation of\ncivic and community engagement, built on the values they brought with them from\ntheir life in New Hampshire and ancestors before. Values I was taught by my\nfamily and carried into my career in philanthropy and voter engagement -\nstarting with a grant-making foundation for people of my generation to support\nsocial action and community organizing of the era. It was no surprise my\nventures into philanthropy soon came with the nickname the “Dough Boy.”\n\nSally and George campaign in Independence, MNMy other brand was my parents,\nGeorge and Sally Pillsbury. In their 56-year marriage as political and civic\nactivists, they were hard to miss at any venue or gathering for community\nservice or on the campaign trail. Except for two years in New York, they lived\nin and devoted their whole 90+ years to Minnesota.\n\nMy father (1922-2012 [https://www.startribune.com/obituaries/detail/13635262/]),\nwas born in his parents’ house west of Minneapolis on Lake Minnetonka. A\ngraduate of Yale University and a U.S. Marine, he was the last in the family to\nwork for the Pillsbury company, later serving 12 years in the Minnesota State\nSenate.\n\nMy mother (1924-2018 [https://www.startribune.com/obituaries/detail/0000242819/]\n), grew up in St. Cloud, a small city northwest of the Twin Cities. Having moved\nwith her family to Lake Minnetonka not far from my father, she graduated Smith\nCollege and made a name for herself in community service and politics.\n\nThey both strived at every opportunity to promote the moderate Lincoln wing of\nthe Republican party and its values. My father, well into his 80s at the time,\nwasbanned\n[https://www.mprnews.org/story/2010/12/04/republican-central-committee] by the\nstate party for supporting an Independent candidate.\n\nEarly years\nMy first memory of politics was joining my mother at the 1958 Minnesota\nRepublican convention where teen entertainment was a hula hoop contest.\nEmbarrassing but fun. It was the start of a steady flow of state and county\nconventions and campaigns run out of our basement or featured at the political\nbooths of the state fair.\n\n1964 GOP Convention, San FranciscoI joined her at the 1964 GOP national\nconvention in San Francisco on behalf of moderate Pennsylvania Governor Bill\nScranton against Barry Goldwater. At the time, His campaign helped move the far\nright to center stage\n[https://www.history.com/news/barry-goldwater-1964-campaign-right-wing-republican]\n. Then in 1968, in the wake of the explosive protests at Chicago's Democratic\nConvention, I went with a youth to Miami to support New York Governor Nelson\nRockefeller against Richard Nixon. The busload of young Republicans included my\nsister Sarah. In distress of the party's choice, on our bus ride home our youth\ngroup issued a press release picked up (to our parents’ surprise) by the local\npapers endorsing the Democratic nominee, Senator Hubert Humphrey (MN).\n\nI still had opportunities to work for Republican moderates. I wasn’t at home\nwith either major party. Like my parents, I wished we had more parties to choose\nfrom.\n\nCollege – 1968 - 2002\nBefore 1968 I saw politics only as what candidate to work for in the next\nelection. This changed as I watched the issues of race and war tear the country\napart. When I moved to live in the diverse working-class city of New Haven to\nenter college at Yale, I was drawn to life outside campus. More engaged by the\ncommunity service work of the New Haven Black Panthers, and the anti-war\nprotests. I didn't give up contesting elections, joining my brother to canvass\nfor the peace campaign of New York's Al Lowenstein. I signed onto join the\nreform mayoral campaign to unseat New Haven's party machine.\n\nFree breakfast program offered by the Black PanthersAt the same time, I made my\nfirst ever political donation. In a short-lived attempt at anonymity, I left\n$200 in cash at the office at the office of the Black Panthers for their free\nbreakfast, health, and community education programs. I let them have my car to\nhelp residents visit family members in prison. This side of my volunteer work\nearned me a substantial FBI file informed by the New Haven police tapping my\ndorm room phone. A few years later a letter arrived with a $1,000 check from a\nclass action suit I signed onto against the New Haven PD.\n\nWomen break a 265-year gender barrierI had some memorable college classes, but\nmaybe because of the family I grew up with, I learned the most from what\nhappened outside them. My friendship with the Panther leaders taught me lessons\nin personal relations across different backgrounds. As did two weeks on a picket\nline with the dining hall and janitorial workers. Yale going co-ed in my\nsophomore year (I'd been at boys' schools since 3rd grade), brought a new\nconnection and appreciation of strong women like my mother and two sisters. In\n1969 outnumbered by eight to one, 455 women brought feminism to campus,\ninterrupting a men's club of 265 years.\n\nHaymarket Foundation\nMy first job after college was doing a season of tax preparation for H&R Block.\nI had graduated a semester late, and had taken their tax prep course in the fall\nso I would have a job in January when I moved northeast to Cambridge. In my\nCentral Square office, I had a chance to learn the ins and outs of deductions\nand help area residents like presidential biographerDoris Kearns Goodwin\n[https://doriskearnsgoodwin.com/]and future author,Joe Klein\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Klein], then a columnist for city's\nalternative weekly,The Real Paper. In the evenings I volunteered at a free tax\nclinic for low-income residents sponsored by Fair Share, a community group in\nneighboring Chelsea.\n\nIn 1972, As the tax season wound down and I wondered what was next, I got a\ntimely call from my mother. She had just met someone my age at the national\nmeeting of the Council of Foundations, held that year in Minneapolis. As was her\nnature, she introduced herself to the youngest person there, the one with the\npony tail and sneakers. Obie Benz, a Sunbeam Bread heir, had started the\nVanguard Foundation in San Francisco as a way for young people with inherited\nwealth to support social change initiatives in the Bay area. Urged on by my\ncollege friend, Lynn Rosengarten, I decided to give it a try in Boston. We\ntraveled west to meet Obie and Vanguard volunteer Anne Hess. Annie had\nexperience from a family foundation, the Stern Family Fund. At the time, it was\none of the few national foundations to focus on supporting activism. Its\ndirectorDavid Hunter\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/30/nyregion/david-hunter-84-innovator-in-matching-philanthropies.html]\nwould be invaluable in helping us get started.\n\nMy mother visits our officeNew to Boston and with less money than people\nexpected from my last name, I had to find others like myself to join in. In time\nthey did, and the Haymarket Foundation started at 2 Holyoke Street in Harvard\nSquare. It offered an opportunity for young donors in New England to support\norganizing and community empowerment. Empowerment included sharing the power to\nmake grants with experienced local leaders. Haymarket also gave its donors, many\nof whom remained anonymous, a chance to meet with others like themselves to\ndiscuss personal issues related to inherited wealth and living out the values\nthat drew them to Haymarket in the first place.\n\nFunding Exchange\nBook cover by Barbara Garzer, 1977We first reached a national audience with the\npublication of our book, Robin Hood Was Right\n[https://www.abebooks.com/9780960197415/Robin-Hood-right-guide-giving-0960197419/plp]\n, a gift-giving guide to funding social change. Talk show hosts Phil Donahue and\nOprah Winfrey invited us on to talk about the book, and, in a friendly way, ask\nquestions like why we were supporting causes that could well reduce our wealth\nadvantage.\n\nIn the wake of the publicity, young donors started similar community foundations\nin Atlanta, New York, Chicago, Minneapolis and elsewhere. We created a national\nconsortium called the Funding Exchange to support their growth and, as a\nnational network engage other foundations in a conversation about social change\nphilanthropy and the value of more diversity to their boards.\n\nThe Film Fund\nPoster for 1976 Oscar winning documentary Harlan County, USA. Produced and\ndirected by Barbara Kopple.Our foundations lacked the expertise to fund the\nmedia arts, like documentary films that could dramatize the issues we addressed.\nIn response, my Haymarket co-founder David Crocker and I joined producer Miles\nMogulescu to create The Film Fund, as a vehicle to support and give visibility\nto social issue documentaries such as ones we'd invested in individually: 1976\nOscar-winning, Harlan County USA\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_County,_USA] and 1977 Oscar nominee Union\nMaids [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Maids].\n\nWe recruited a panel of experienced filmmakers including Barbara Kopple and\nJulia Reichert, the directors of the above films, and renowned cinematographer\nHaskell Wexler to evaluate promising documentaries already in production and in\nneed of a boost or finishing costs. The Film Fund had a ten-year life,\ncontributing with others to the emergence of the independent documentary film\nlandscape we see today.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy the 1990s, the nonprofit and philanthropic sector had grown exponentially.\nMany more traditional community and private foundations, as well as new ones\nsimilar to ours, had incorporated a more systemic approach to addressing social\nissues through advocacy and community building. At the same time, it became more\nevident that progress on any issue depended on a democracy and government that\nworked and had the trust and participation of its citizens. That brought me back\nto my family roots in good government and elections.\n\nIn 1994, a mid-career year program at the Harvard Kennedy School gave me an\nopportunity to explore best practices for elections among the states and in\ncountries similar to ours. On graduation, I took a job with the Commonwealth\nCoalition, a network of advocacy groups working to elect reform candidates to\nthe state legislature. The Commonwealth Coalition also had two democracy\nprograms. The Money and Politics, which I was hired to direct, and Voter Power,\nwhere I joined Malia Lazu to start Boston Vote.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBoston Vote – MassVOTE\nAs voter turnout in Boston hit rock bottom, local nonprofit leaders approached\nus to see if their community-based organizations could get the people they\nserved every day to register and vote. As long as voter participation in their\nneighborhoods remained low, they'd continue to be overlooked by campaigns and\nelected officials.\n\nTogether we started Boston Vote to train nonprofits on what they could do on a\nnon-partisan basis to encourage voting and better understand its broader\nbenefits to their mission and people they served. Boston Vote, which became\nMassVOTE, also worked with local election officers and state officials to\nimprove voter access and education. Along the way it won some key voting rights\nvictories, including an effort that led to the high-profile resignation of a\nHouse Speaker who tried to gerrymander Boston's black community and dilute their\nvote.\n\nNonprofit VOTE\nIn 2004, we discovered that the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits ran a program\nsimilar to MassVOTE. Its advocacy director, Marcia Avner, contacted us about a\ncollaboration to share our models with other states. Nonprofit associations in\nMichigan, Ohio, North Carolina, Louisiana, and Maine were some of the earliest\nto join what would become Nonprofit VOTE. With the help of the National Council\nof Nonprofits, it initially focused on training and resourcing other state\nnonprofit conveners to make voter engagement part of their programing.\n\nThrough its website, communications, and national partnerships, it reached a\n50-state audience for its nonpartisan resources and trainings to help nonprofits\nintegrate voter engagement into their ongoing activities and services.\n\nSome of the early national partnerships were with nonprofit convenors like the\nNational Council of Nonprofits, Independent Sector, and United Way, and networks\nlike the National Association of Community Health Centers, Goodwill Industries,\nFeeding America, and Alliance for Strong Families and Communities\n[https://www.alliance1.org/web/about/web/about-us.aspx].\n\nNonprofit VOTE soon became the official partner for the nonprofit sector for the\nNational Association of Secretaries of State. With their support, in 2012 it\nco-founded National Voter Registration Day, which has become an annual\nnonpartisan civic holiday celebrating our democracy. With Nonprofit Vote as its\nmanager, it has gained momentum ever since. Nearly 4.5 million voters have\nregistered to vote on the holiday to date.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"page","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2021-12-15T15:41:04.000Z","updated_at":"2022-06-01T17:50:48.000Z","published_at":"2021-12-15T15:41:25.000Z","custom_excerpt":"I was in born the son of Minnesotans George Sturgis Pillsbury and Sally Lucille (Whitney) Pillsbury in 1949, entering the world with a brand name passed down by my great grandfather Charles A.

It\nallows voters with valid ID and proof of residency to register or update their\nregistration when they vote on Election Day or during the early voting period\nToday there is no reason any state should let a fixable registration issue\nprevent citizens of voting age from voting.\n\nBenefits\n * No voter is turned away by fixable voter registration issues. Voters still\n   have a chance to register or correct a mistake in a previous registration\n   when they vote. This is especially beneficial for first-time voters.\n   \n   \n * It Increases accuracy of registration rolls. Unlike registrations mailed in\n   or done online, same day registrations are done in person by trained election\n   officials\n   \n   \n * Saves the added cost of and uncertainty of using provisional ballots now used\n   for voters not properly on the list.\n   \n   \n * This voter friendly policy has long been cited in political science research\n   as likely to increase voter turnout by three to seven percentage points once\n   implemented, even after controlling for other factors.\n   \n   \n\nResources\nNational Conference of State Legislators: List of states with SDR how it works\nhttps://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx\n\nCaltech/MIT Voting Technology Project: Working Paper #5\nhttps://vote.caltech.edu/working-papers\n\nNonprofit VOTE Voting in Your State links to state voter registration policies\non their state election website.\nhttps://www.nonprofitvote.org/voting-in-your-state/\n\nSame Day Registration States\n * California\n * Colorado\n * Connecticut\n * District of Columbia\n * Hawaii\n * Idaho\n * Illinois\n * Iowa\n * Maine\n * Maryland\n * Michigan\n * Minnesota\n * Montana*\n * Nevada\n * New Hampshire\n * New Mexico\n * North Carolina*\n * North Dakota\n * Utah\n * Vermont\n * Virginia\n * Washington\n * Wisconsin\n * Wyoming\n\n*during early voting period only\n\nStates in dark blue have Same Day Registration","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/sdr-sign.jpg","featured":0,"type":"page","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-05-27T17:03:36.000Z","updated_at":"2022-06-28T16:49:16.000Z","published_at":"2022-05-27T17:09:39.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null},{"id":"62ab5089638eb2003d274580","uuid":"2eb4c6ca-6dcc-410f-ac06-0281489bac7a","title":"Automatic Voter Registration","slug":"automatic-voter-registration","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<h1 id=\\\"automatic-voter-registration\\\">Automatic Voter Registration</h1>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"font-family:Georgia\\\">Nearly a quarter of all eligible voters are not registered to vote.

As it stands, that’s true for all advanced\ndemocracies except the United States. One reason is that our Constitution gave\naway most election administration to the states without establishing any\nnational standards for impartiality. Since 2020, six states—Alabama, Arizona,\nFlorida, Georgia, Kentucky, and Oklahoma—have passed new laws that open the door\nto partisan inter­fer­ence in elec­tions and/or threaten the people and\nprocesses that make elec­tions work.\n\nImpartial election administration does still occur in practice. In the 2020\nelection, we saw top election officials resist outside pressure to change the\nfinal count, and the state electors were certified to decide the presidential\nelection. Fortunately, these officials followed nonpartisan principles, drawing\non their professional commitment to impartiality based on their understanding of\nthe oath they took to uphold their state constitution. But nowhere are there\nnational standards for impartiality built into the administrative design.\n\nToday, in most states, the position of chief election official is held by the\nsecretary of state, who is elected and takes office aligned with a political\nparty. Recently, partisanship has been on the rise. In 2020, the Election\nReformers Network and the Campaign Legal Center issued a report, “Guardrails for\nthe Guardians,” that found since 2000:\n\n * Of the 137 elected secretaries of state serving between 2000 and 2020, 46\n   made at least one public endorsement for a candidate running in a race under\n   their supervision.\n * 12 served as a co-chair of a presidential election campaign.\n * 153 sitting secretaries of state have run for office without any available\n   evidence that the secretary took any public step to be recused from any\n   conflict of interest, such as overseeing their own re-election or election to\n   a higher office.\n * At the same time, the political action committees of the Democratic and\n   Republican Associations of Secretaries of State weighed in on elections\n   through fundraising, endorsements, and electioneering.\n\nTen states have nonpartisan election boards or commissions to run elections. A\nstep forward, though done largely to balance the interests of the two major\nparties.\n\nHow it Should Work: Recommendations\nThe Election Reformers Network\n[https://electionreformers.org/guardrails-report/], made up of past election\nadministrators, recommends that states:\n\n * Separate the election function from the office of the secretary of state and\n   into a new dedicated entity. For example, a more neutral and apolitical\n   version of current U.S. state election boards or commissions.\n * Include on these election boards members who are politically independent. \n * Consider calling on retired judges as is often done in other countries for\n   this purpose.\n * Add or incorporate an oath of impartiality to be taken by those most\n   responsible for election administration.\n * Prohibit partisan actions by secretaries of state and election board members,\n   such as public endorsements of candidates running for office, accepting\n   campaign positions for candidates or ballot questions, and fundraising and\n   electioneering for or against any candidate.\n\nBenefits\n * National standards for nonpartisanship set a clearer roadmap for all states\n   to follow for national and state elections.\n * Removing the cloud of partisan intervention in elections that undermines\n   public trust in elections and government.\n * Standard oaths of office for secretaries of state or other election officials\n   would make commitments to impartiality more explicit.\n\nImpartial election administration doesn’t guarantee confidence in fair\nelections. But keeping elections under partisan control will guarantee that the\npublic’s declining trust in voting and elections\n[https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/americans-faith-election-integrity-drops-poll/story?id=82069876] \nwill continue. Election administrators held the line\n[https://elections-blog.mit.edu/articles/2020-was-banner-year-us-election-administration] \nin 2020; 2022 will be the next test.\n\nResources\nElection Reformers Network.

As the American\nProbation and Parole Association\n[https://www.appa-net.org/eweb/Dynamicpage.aspx?webcode=IB_Resolution&wps_key=3c8f5612-9e1c-4f60-8e8b-1bf46c00138e] \nsaid, “disenfranchisement laws work against the successful reentry of\noffenders.”\n\nDisenfranchisement laws differ wildly\n[https://campaignlegal.org/restoreyourvote] among states. Misunderstood by\nvoters and election officials, they end up being costly to maintain and\naccurately administer. As a result, thousands of eligible voters with any past\nconviction don’t vote, wrongly believing\n[https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/de-facto-disenfranchisement] \nthey’d break the law if they did, while others, unaware of their state’s\nprohibition, may be arrested for voting.  For example, Crystal Mason\n[https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/11/crystal-mason-illegal-voting-texas/] \nwas sentenced to five years in prison for casting a provisional ballot\nmistakenly given to her by a poll worker in Texas.\n\nCrystal MasonBrief History\nDisenfranchisement laws imported from England\n[https://origins.osu.edu/article/voting-crime-and-race-history-stolen-citizenship-disenfranchisement-felony] \nwere repurposed by ten confederate states\n[http://users.cla.umn.edu/~uggen/Behrens_Uggen_Manza_ajs.pdf] to limit the\npolitical voice of Black Americans granted citizenship and the right to vote\nafter the Civil War and the 13th and 14thAmendments. More states would follow.\nToday, these laws continue to have the largest impact on African-Americans, who\nare four times\n[https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/08/20/jim-crow-s-lasting-legacy-at-the-ballot-box] \nmore likely than all other racial groups to lose their voting rights.\n\nBenefits\nThere are multiple benefits for the individual and society to allowing people to\nvote as soon as they exit prison include a more successful re-entry into\ncommunity life and better citizenship, lower recidivism rates, reduced crime,\nand greater public safety.\n\n *  More successful rehabilitation and re-entry\n   In line with the purpose of probation and parole to facilitate the successful\n   reintegration, people who vote are more likely to volunteer, gain employment,\n   stay informed on local affairs, and contribute to their neighborhood in other\n   ways.\n   \n   \n *  Better citizenship\n   The field’s most published sociologists, Christopher Uggen and Jeff Manza,\n   observe, the “restoration of voting rights provides a clear marker of\n   reintegration and acceptance as a stakeholder in a community of more\n   law-abiding and engaged citizens.”\n   \n   \n *  Lower recidivism rates\n   Studies show people who vote are less likely to commit new crimes. In\n   Minnesota, young offenders who became voters were half as likely to commit\n   crimes and be rearrested. In Oregon recidivism was cut by 25% among people on\n   probation and parole who voted. The Florida Parole Commission saw the\n   recidivism rate reduced by almost two-thirds for those whose voting and civil\n   rights were restored.\n   \n   \n *  Increased public safety\n   The reduced crime and better citizenship that comes with voting enhances\n   public safety. Voting encourages people to invest in their communities by\n   allowing them to participate as citizens and have a voice in issues that\n   affect them. When asked about ending post-release voting restrictions,\n   Minnesota Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said, “What makes us safer is\n   having people be engaged.”\n   \n   \n\nConclusion\nMarrying voting with our criminal justice system has always been problematic.\nWithholding the vote from those rebuilding their lives on probation or parole is\nneither practical nor does it advance any public interest for the either the\nperson or the communities they return to. Regardless of the offense, society\nneeds everyone convicted of a crime to change their behavior for the better.\n\nResources\nNonprofit VOTE: Policies by state for voting rights for people with felony\nconvictions \n\nhttps://www.nonprofitvote.org/voting-in-your-state/voting-as-an-ex-offender/\n\nCampaign Legal Center: Look up tool on “Can I vote with a felony conviction in\nmy state?\"\n\nhttps://campaignlegal.org/restoreyourvote\n\nBrennan Center for Justice: Overview\n\nhttps://www.brennancenter.org/issues/ensure-every-american-can-vote/voting-rights-restoration/disenfranchisement-laws\n\nThe Sentencing Project: Overview\n\nhttps://www.sentencingproject.org/ issues/voting-rights/\n[https://www.sentencingproject.org/%20issues/voting-rights/]\n\nStates Restoring Voting Rights on Release from Prison\n25 states continue to bar voting after prison for people on probation, parole,\nor any type of supervised release.
