<p>After ending my first job out of college as a tax preparer for H&amp;R Block, a call from my mother about a youth-run foundation to support activism in San Francisco sparked the idea of organizing my peers to try the same in Boston.</p>
<p>I had learned something about organizing from my activist mom. I&rsquo;d also picked up some organizing principles volunteering evenings at a free tax clinic sponsored by Chelsea Fair Share. Its leaders, <a href="https://forgeorganizing.org/article/best-action-ever">Mark and Barbara Splain</a>, taught me the value offering a service as part of earning trust and a chance to meet people who might join your cause. In their case an organization to build power among Chelsea&rsquo;s low-income residents. It was a lesson I took with me for the rest of my career.</p>
<h2>Philanthropy Years &ndash;&nbsp;Change not Charity</h2>
<h3 style="margin-top:32px">The Haymarket Foundation and the Funding Exchange</h3>
<p>Having grown up more as a volunteer then a leader of campaigns, my first organizing project was the Haymarket People&rsquo;s Fund. I started with advice from local faith programs that already made grants to community empowerment projects. Their unique approach included actively engaging members of the community in the awarding of grants. From there, I drafted a plan to create a foundation as my final paper for a degree in American Studies from Goddard College, where I had been studying. The course would also provide the name, a cross between the historic Haymarket Chicago protest for the eight-hour workday and Boston&rsquo;s 300-year-old food market, with the same name.</p>
<p>Haymarket and the other alternative community funds that would form across the county sought to create a new generation of donors to support social change philanthropy. Under the banner of &ldquo;Change not Charity,&rdquo; we looked to invest in local organizations addressing the root causes of problems and taking steps towards more systemic and lasting solutions for the issues of the day. We hoped our grants would give visibility and credibility that could result in funding from the more established foundations. Often that was the case.</p>
<p>Among those with inherited wealth that came of age in the social movements of the &rsquo;60s and &rsquo;70s, there was interest in funding those movements&mdash;but many of them wanted anonymity, so the challenge was to find them. In line with the idea of first offering a service, we found success in organizing gatherings for people with family wealth; offering a safe environment to discuss the personal issues related to coming into inherited wealth. A place to talk about impact on relationships, concerns about where their money came from, and how to have a conversation with their families or financial gatekeepers about using it to support activism.</p>
<p>Haymarket had its first local donor meetings in partnership with the American Friends Service Committee. The Quaker network&rsquo;s own donors had also asked for a personal retreat like this. It was established that the meeting had the assurance of anonymity and there would be no fundraising on site. National gatherings began when our mentor, David Hunter of the Stern Family Fund, convened the donors he advised to meet on a personal basis. Over time, the private meetings grew and moved to different locations around the country. These meetings would come to include activist leaders and guests who could offer their perspectives on social impact grantmaking. Through our formative years, we sponsored workshops and retreats like this&mdash;locally and nationally&mdash;that generated spin-offs and like-minded initiatives that supported a national trend to social change grantmaking.</p>
<p>Along with the change in the kind of grants made came a shift in power of who made them. We made a break from the private trustee model of grantmaking, where grants were approved by a board of family members or related legal and financial professionals, administered by a family office. We opted instead to have funding boards reflect the issues and communities where the grants were being made. It seemed more effective to have local leaders with grassroots organizing experience lead the process, and it was more in line with our values to have the grantmaking process itself be an extension of community empowerment.</p>
<p>In forming Haymarket&rsquo;s founding board, we included activists like clerical worker Karen Nussbaum, who founded the organization 9to5, later made famous by the movie of the same name and <a href="https://www.biography.com/news/dolly-parton-9-to-5-theme-song">Dolly Parton song</a>. Another member was Walter Porter, the community-based chair of a Boston association for minority firefighters. Robert Zevin, a lifelong activist and pioneer in the field of socially responsible investing, was also involved. Ann Froines, advocate for women leaders, joined our board. This model gave activists the opportunity to be donors, and donors a chance to engage with those they supported. Other public foundations like ours that started later with a similar mission also opted for this approach.</p>
<p>In another break with traditional philanthropy, we went public. At the time only the United Way had TV ads and no one had a website. Because we were new and had to find new donors to join in our cause, we turned to marketing and outreach. It meant having a presence at foundation gatherings. It gave birth to the publication <a href="https://www.abebooks.com/9780960197415/Robin-Hood-right-guide-giving-0960197419/plp">Robin Hood Was Right</a>, inspired by and edited by author Adam Hochschild. The book, published in 1977 featured our funds and attracted a national audience with appearances on the Oprah Winfrey and Phil Donahue shows and coverage from the New York Times to Parade magazine, Town and Country, and **more**</p>
<p>In the wake of the publicity, young donors started 15 similar community foundations in areas like Atlanta, New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, and one in Los Angeles, <a href="https://www.libertyhill.org/who-we-are/about-us/#Our-History">Liberty Hill Foundation</a>, founded by my sister Sarah Pillsbury. As we grew, it became clear that we would benefit from an association. We created a national consortium called the <a href="https://fex.org/">Funding Exchange</a> to support the growth of the local funds and to advance the conversation with other foundations around social change philanthropy.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is not the history of a single foundation. It is the story of many similar efforts that built a movement to reshape philanthropy and build a community of foundations that shared a common social justice mission. Together we promoted the benefits of strategic grantmaking that sought to promote longer-term systemic approaches to the issues of the day.</p>
