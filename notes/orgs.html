<p>
  After ending my first job out of college as a tax preparer for H&amp;R Block,
  a call from my mother about a youth-run foundation to support activism in San
  Francisco sparked the idea of organizing my peers to try the same in Boston.
</p>
<p>
  I had learned something about organizing from my activist mom. I&rsquo;d also
  picked up some organizing principles volunteering evenings at a free tax
  clinic sponsored by Chelsea Fair Share. Its leaders,
  <a href="https://forgeorganizing.org/article/best-action-ever"
    >Mark and Barbara Splain</a
  >, taught me the value of offering a service as part of earning trust and a
  chance to meet people who might join your cause. In their case an organization
  to build power among Chelsea&rsquo;s low-income residents. It was a lesson I
  took with me for the rest of my career.

<p>
  Having grown up more as a volunteer than a leader of campaigns, my first
  organizing project was the Haymarket People&rsquo;s Fund. I started with
  advice from local faith programs that already made grants to community
  empowerment projects. Their unique approach included actively engaging members
  of the community in the awarding of grants. From there, I drafted a plan to
  create a foundation as my final paper for a degree in American Studies from
  Goddard College, where I had been studying. The course would also provide the
  name, a cross between the historic Haymarket Chicago protest for the
  eight-hour workday and Boston&rsquo;s 300-year-old food market, with the same
  name.

</figure>
<p>
  Haymarket and the other alternative community funds that would form across the
  country sought to create a new generation of donors to support social change
  philanthropy. Under the banner of &ldquo;Change not Charity,&rdquo; we looked
  to invest in local organizations addressing the root causes of problems and
  taking steps towards more systemic and lasting solutions for the issues of the
  day. We hoped our grants would give visibility and credibility that could
  result in funding from the more established foundations. Often that was the
  case.
</p>
<p>
  Among those with inherited wealth that came of age in the social movements of
  the &rsquo;60s and &rsquo;70s, there was interest in funding those
  movements&mdash;but many of them wanted anonymity, so the challenge was to
  find them. In line with the idea of first offering a service, we found success
  in organizing gatherings for people with family wealth; offering a safe
  environment to discuss the personal issues related to coming into inherited
  wealth. A place to talk about impact on relationships, concerns about where
  their money came from, and how to have a conversation with their families or
  financial gatekeepers about using it to support activism.
</p>
<p>
  Haymarket had its first local donor meetings in partnership with the American
  Friends Service Committee. The Quaker network&rsquo;s own donors had also
  asked for a personal retreat like this. It was established that the meeting
  had the assurance of anonymity and there would be no fundraising on site.
  National gatherings began when our mentor, David Hunter of the Stern Family
  Fund, convened the donors he advised to meet on a personal basis. Over time,
  the private meetings grew and moved to different locations around the country.
  These meetings would come to include activist leaders and guests who could
  offer their perspectives on social impact grantmaking. Through our formative
  years, we sponsored workshops and retreats like this&mdash;locally and
  nationally&mdash;that generated spin-offs and like-minded initiatives that
  supported a national trend to social change grantmaking.

</figure>
<p>
  Along with the change in the kind of grants made came a shift in power of who
  made them. We made a break from the private trustee model of grantmaking,
  where grants were approved by a board of family members or related legal and
  financial professionals, administered by a family office. We opted instead to
  have funding boards reflect the issues and communities where the grants were
  being made. It seemed more effective to have local leaders with grassroots
  organizing experience lead the process, and it was more in line with our
  values to have the grantmaking process itself be an extension of community
  empowerment.
</p>

<p>
  In forming Haymarket&rsquo;s founding board, we included activists like
  clerical worker Karen Nussbaum, who founded the organization 9to5, later made
  famous by the movie of the same name and
  <a href="https://www.biography.com/news/dolly-parton-9-to-5-theme-song"
    >Dolly Parton song</a
  >. Another member was Walter Porter, the community-based chair of a Boston
  association for minority firefighters. Robert Zevin, a lifelong activist and
  pioneer in the field of socially responsible investing, was also involved. Ann
  Froines, advocate for women leaders, joined our board. This model gave
  activists the opportunity to be donors, and donors a chance to engage with
  those they supported. Other public foundations like ours that started later
  with a similar mission also opted for this approach.

  In another break with traditional philanthropy, we went public. At the time
  only the United Way had TV ads and no one had a website. Because we were new
  and had to find new donors to join in our cause, we turned to marketing and
  outreach. It meant having a presence at foundation gatherings. It gave birth
  to the publication
  <a

    >Robin Hood Was Right</a
  >, inspired by and edited by author Adam Hochschild. The book, published in
  1977 featured our funds and attracted a national audience with appearances on
  the Oprah Winfrey and Phil Donahue shows and coverage from the New York Times
  to Parade magazine, Town and Country, and others.

<p>
  In the wake of the publicity, young donors started 15 similar community
  foundations in areas like Atlanta, New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, and one in
  Los Angeles,
  <a href="https://www.libertyhill.org/who-we-are/about-us/#Our-History"
    >Liberty Hill Foundation</a
  >, founded by my sister Sarah Pillsbury. As we grew, it became clear that we
  would benefit from an association. We created a national consortium called the
  <a href="https://fex.org/">Funding Exchange</a> to support the growth of the
  local funds and to advance the conversation with other foundations around
  social change philanthropy.
</p>
<hr style="display:block; margin-bottom: 40px; text-align:center;" />
<p>
  This is not the history of a single foundation. It is the story of many
  similar efforts that built a movement to reshape philanthropy and build a
  community of foundations that shared a common social justice mission. Together
  we promoted the benefits of strategic grantmaking that sought to promote
  longer-term systemic approaches to the issues of the day.

<h2 id="voter-engagement">Voter Engagement and Voting Rights</h2>

<p>
  Among the foundations and nonprofits I worked with, it was often said that the
  money they had to address social issues was only a fraction of what government
  could do.
</p>

<p>
  The long-term success of these organizations depended on a partnership with
  responsive government representatives who were accountable to the communities
  they served. In other words, a healthy and functioning democracy.
</p>

<p>
  In the 1990s, this trend was going in the wrong direction. Voter turnout
  hovered at historic lows. More than half of eligible voters didn&rsquo;t vote
  in midterms and fewer in local elections, most notably voters that were
  low-income, young, or relatively new citizens.
</p>

<p>
  If the nonprofit sector wanted to strengthen democracy and have their voices
  heard, it had to do its part to make sure that the people they served voted.
</p>

<p>
  Most nonprofits, however, mistakenly believed that their charitable status
  meant they couldn&rsquo;t talk to their clients and constituents about voting.
  While private foundations faced some limitations, the IRS clearly stated that
  all public 501c3 charities could do any amount of voter registration and
  education, including helping people participate and vote. As long as they did
  so on a

  The nonprofit sector had largely left untapped their inherent capacity to
  increase voter participation among those voters with a history of low voter
  turnout. They are already trusted messengers, deeply rooted in their local
  communities. They have day-to-day personal contact with potential voters often
  missed by candidates and campaigns more narrowly focused on attracting already
  likely voters. What&rsquo;s more, their non-partisan approach tends to work
  better with new voters seeking the help and information needed to be a voter.

<p>
  After a mid-career year at the Harvard Kennedy School focused on electoral
  reform, I had my first chance to work at a democracy organization, the Boston
  based Commonwealth Coalition. The coalition, originally set up to help
  progressive reform-oriented candidates run for office, added programs
  challenging the role of money in state politics and encouraging people to vote
  in local elections. I was recruited to run the money and politics program.

<p>
  One of my first calls was from an Emerson College student, Malia Lazu, about
  her effort to hold a concert for democracy on the Boston Common, the
  city&rsquo;s downtown public park. Malia had heard about the benefit concert,
  headlined by Bob Marley, for liberation movements in Southern Africa that I
  helped produce while working at Haymarket foundation. When the city turned
  down her request for a permit because it feared problems with a multiracial
  audience, she volunteered to work for democracy at the Coalition, and was soon
  directing the &ldquo;Voter Power&rdquo; initiative.
</p>

<p>
  We shared our disillusion with the state of politics. Particularly its
  troubled history of racial bias, where election outcomes were decided in
  primaries in districts designed to favor mostly white incumbents. On Election
  Day voters had few, if any, choices on the ballot, and too little reason to
  vote.
</p>

<p>
  Malia and I met with Boston nonprofit and foundation leaders about a pilot
  program specifically focused on training nonprofits to integrate voter and
  civic participation into programs they already offered on a nonpartisan basis.
  A civic venture we hoped would bring higher turnout and might encourage more
  candidates to run, despite the odds, making elections more competitive.

<p>
  Voter Power became <strong>Boston VOTE</strong>. Starting in Boston, it
  recruited a board of nonprofit leaders from 18 of its lower turnout
  neighborhoods. One was Kim Janey who, two decades later, would become the
  city&rsquo;s first African-American and woman mayor, herself a reflection of a
  changing Boston.
</p>

<p>
  By our second year we had signed up more than 120 nonprofits serving the low
  turnout neighborhoods. Boston VOTE reached out to service providers,
  neighborhood development organizations, advocacy organizations, community
  health centers and the like. Each nonprofit received voter engagement training
  focused on voter registration, helping people become voters, and strategies to
  integrate voter outreach into ongoing programs while remaining nonpartisan.

  Boston VOTE grew on the strength of its nonprofit outreach and these early
  partners that developed their own voter engagement initiatives, including

      neighborhoods received services. In both cities, the plaintiffs we
