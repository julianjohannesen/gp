<h2>Voter Engagement and Voting Rights</h2>

<p>
  Among the foundations and nonprofits I worked with, it was often said that the
  money they had to address social issues was only a fraction of what government
  could do.
</p>

<p>
  The long-term success of these organizations depended on a partnership with
  responsive government representatives who were accountable to the communities
  they served. In other words, a healthy and functioning democracy.
</p>

<p>
  In the 1990s, this trend was going in the wrong direction. Voter turnout
  hovered at historic lows. More than half of eligible voters didn&rsquo;t vote
  in midterms and fewer in local elections, most notably voters that were
  low-income, young, or relatively new citizens.
</p>

<p>
  If the nonprofit sector wanted to strengthen democracy and have their voices
  heard, it had to do its part to make sure that the people they served voted.
</p>

<p>
  Most nonprofits, however, mistakenly believed that their charitable status
  meant they couldn&rsquo;t talk to their clients and constituents about voting.
  While private foundations faced some limitations, the IRS clearly stated that
  all public 501c3 charities could do any amount of voter registration and
  education, including helping people participate and vote. As long as they did
  so on a

</p>

<p>
  The nonprofit sector had largely left untapped their inherent capacity to
  increase voter participation among those voters with a history of low voter
  turnout. They are already trusted messengers, deeply rooted in their local
  communities. They have day-to-day personal contact with potential voters often
  missed by candidates and campaigns more narrowly focused on attracting already
  likely voters. What&rsquo;s more, their non-partisan approach tends to work
  better with new voters seeking the help and information needed to be a voter.

<h3>BostonVOTE, MassVOTE</h3>

<p>
  After a mid-career year at the Harvard Kennedy School focused on electoral
  reform, I had my first chance to work at a democracy organization, the Boston
  based Commonwealth Coalition. The coalition, originally set up to help
  progressive reform-oriented candidates run for office, added programs
  challenging the role of money in state politics and encouraging people to vote
  in local elections. I was recruited to run the money and politics program.

  />
  One of my first calls was from an Emerson College student, Malia Lazu, about
  her effort to hold a concert for democracy on the Boston Common, the
  city&rsquo;s downtown public park. Malia had heard about the benefit concert,
  headlined by Bob Marley, for liberation movements in Southern Africa that I
  helped produce while working at Haymarket foundation. When the city turned
  down her request for a permit because it feared problems with a multiracial
  audience, she volunteered to work for democracy at the Coalition, and was soon
  directing the &ldquo;Voter Power&rdquo; initiative.
</p>

<p>
  We shared our disillusion with the state of politics. Particularly its
  troubled history of racial bias, where election outcomes were decided in
  primaries in districts designed to favor mostly white incumbents. On Election
  Day voters had few, if any, choices on the ballot, and too little reason to
  vote.
</p>

<p>
  Malia and I met with Boston nonprofit and foundation leaders about a pilot
  program specifically focused on training nonprofits to integrate voter and
  civic participation into programs they already offered on a nonpartisan basis.
  A civic venture we hoped would bring higher turnout and might encourage more
  candidates to run, despite the odds, making elections more competitive.
</p>

  />
  Voter Power became <strong>Boston VOTE</strong>. Starting in Boston, it
  recruited a board of nonprofit leaders from 18 of its lower turnout
  neighborhoods. One was Kim Janey who, two decades later, would become the
  city&rsquo;s first African-American and woman mayor, herself a reflection of a
  changing Boston.
</p>

<p>
  By our second year we had signed up more than 120 nonprofits serving the low
  turnout neighborhoods. Boston VOTE reached out to service providers,
  neighborhood development organizations, advocacy organizations, community
  health centers and the like. Each nonprofit received voter engagement training
  focused on voter registration, helping people become voters, and strategies to
  integrate voter outreach into ongoing programs while remaining nonpartisan.
</p>

<p>
  Boston VOTE grew on the strength of its nonprofit outreach and these early
  partners that developed their own voter engagement initiatives, including

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Dunk the Vote:</strong> A multi-faceted civic empowerment group,
      that had it start registering young black voters at youth basketball
      competitions set up for that purpose. They would partner with us on a
      voter registration canvass call Knock Across Boston.

      <strong>Mass Council for Human Service Providers:</strong> A founding
      partner, it has its own Care VOTE program to encourages human services
      employees, clients, consumers, board members and friends to register and
      vote.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Chinese Progressive Association (CPA):</strong> CPA tripled
      neighborhood turnout in its first city election. It became an advocate for
      fair redistricting and translation for ballots and for city hall hearings
      so all residents could fully participate.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Codman Square Health Center: </strong>One of the first health
      centers to do voter engagement. It used dedicated volunteers and staff to
      do voter registration on site and at community events.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Madison Park Community Development Corporation:</strong> It hosted
      <em>Rox Vote</em>, a coalition of Roxbury-based organizations to help
      residents register and vote, host candidate forums, and promote youth
      civic leadership.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Mass Immigration and Refugee Advocacy Coalition:</strong> MIRA
      registered new voters at citizenship ceremonies and supported civic
      engagement and advocacy in partnership with its 130 organizational
      members, many that also worked with MassVOTE.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Chelsea Human Services:</strong> An early partner, it organized
      community canvasses to promote voting and recruited young poll workers.
      Today the city&rsquo;s large Latino population is fully represented on the
      city council and school committee.

<h3>A Civic Uprising</h3>

<h4>More Voters</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Turnout rose in city and state elections for all five of our first years
      in the 12 Boston neighborhoods that had the lowest participation in the
      past.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Turnout growth averaged 30 percentage points compared to only 4% in the
      neighborhoods with already higher turnout.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>More Candidates</h4>

/>

<p>
  As turnout rose in the city&rsquo;s more diverse neighborhoods, the diversity
  of candidates rose too. For the first time, in 2004 Boston elected a Latino
  candidate citywide for a City Council at-large seat. &ldquo;An unprecedented
  leap in voting by minorities in Boston.&rdquo; &ndash;The Boston Globe

  />
</p>

<p>
  The next year, a black Cape Verdean candidate became Boston&rsquo;s sheriff.
  &ldquo;Coming on the heels of last year&rsquo;s victory by city councilor
  Arroyo, it signals a shifting landscape in Boston&rsquo;s voting public.
  &hellip; a new era in Boston politics.&rdquo; &ndash;Boston Herald
</p>

<h3>Boston VOTE Becomes MassVOTE</h3>

<p>
  As interest grew in other cities like as Brockton, Lowell, Lawrence, and
  Worcester expanded our name change to <strong>MassVOTE</strong>. We added new
  programs in Boston and policy work statewide on voting and voting rights.
</p>

<h4>New Programs</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Youth Civic Leadership:</strong> Paid internships for Boston youth
      high school students to work with local nonprofits, visit the state house
      and city council, and receive leadership training.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Civic Engagement Initiative:</strong> A collaboration with Boston
      foundations that made grants to nonprofits for voter outreach, and tracked
      who they personally contacted to evaluate their impact on turnout of new
      and infrequent voters.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Census and Redistricting:</strong> A collaboration with our
      largest statewide partners to increase census participation and later
      monitor creation of new election districts.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Voter Access and Fair Elections</h4>

      In 2000, Massachusetts lagged behind many states that already offered good
      options to vote early or by mail, use online registration, or take
      advantage of same day registration, which let voters update their
      registration when they went to vote.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We worked in partnership with the other nonpartisan
      organizations&mdash;League of Women Voters, Common Cause, The Lawyers
      Committee, Mass Public Interest Group&mdash;to form what became the
      Election Modernization Coalition. For more see

<h3>The Voting Rights Lawsuits</h3>

<h4>Racial gerrymandering in Boston</h4>

<p>
  We weren&rsquo;t lawyers, and had no plans to make our first foray into voting
  rights with a lawsuit, but when confronted with evidence of racial
  gerrymandering we took on the challenge.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <img
        alt="Tom Finneran with redistricting map"
        height="396"
        width="465"
        src="../assets/img/massvote/edited/tom-fiinn-mapmaker.webp"
      />
      We had recently decided to purchase newly available redistricting software
      in order to monitor the make-up of the new 2002 district lines the
      legislature was about to draw for Congress and themselves. We invited an
      attorney from the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights (now the Lawyers
      Committee) to help us discuss its impact on the Boston neighborhoods where
      we were working.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The story became one of racial gerrymandering in Boston, a federal lawsuit
      by black voters, the indictment and disbarment of the House speaker and,
      ultimately, justice for the targeted communities. (For the full story)

<h4>Challenging the bias of all At-Large Voting in Springfield and Lowell</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <img

        src="../assets/img/massvote/edited/block-the-vote.webp"
      />
      We continued our collaboration with the Lawyers Committee to challenge
      biased voting methods in Springfield and Lowell. For decades their
      winner-take-all at-large voting method allowed a small group of white
      voters to retain full control of the City Council and School Committee. As
      a result, voters in a few neighborhood wards determined the outcome of
      most all municipal seats, who got hired for city jobs, and which
      neighborhoods received services. In both cities, the plaintiffs we
      represented won their case for fair elections. (For more add link)
