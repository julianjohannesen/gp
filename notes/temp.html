        <p>To be a democracy at some point assumes a set of principles and policies on how we hold elections and vote. Ones we share as a nation, not different from state to state. We carry the legacy and burden of starting with few models for governance and a distrust of being one nation, in a country riven by slavery, where a fraction of the populace even had the right to vote.  While much was done by our founders and later by constitutional amendments to assert principles and policies of an advanced democracy.
