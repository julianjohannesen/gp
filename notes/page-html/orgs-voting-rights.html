<p>
  Among the foundations and nonprofits, I worked with, it was often said that
  the resources they had were only a fraction of what government could
  potentially provide.
</p>
<p>
  The long-term success of any nonprofit organization depended on a partnership
  with a responsive government, both representative and accountable to the
  communities they served. In other words, a healthy and functioning democracy.
</p>
<p>
  In the 1990s, this trend was going in the wrong direction. Voter turnout
  hovered at historic lows. More than half of eligible voters didn’t vote in
  midterms, and even fewer voted in local elections. Most of the absent voters
  were low-income, young, or first time voters new to the political process.

<p>
  If the nonprofit sector wanted to strengthen democracy and have their voices
  heard, one way was to help the people they served to vote.
</p>
<p>
  However, at the time many nonprofits mistakenly believed that their charitable
  status meant they couldn’t talk to their clients and constituents about
  voting. The IRS never said that. The Treasury Department only said in a single
  sentence that 501c3 nonprofits, which most nonprofits are, cannot support or
  oppose candidates for public office. A sentence was added in the 1950s by then
  Senator Lyndon Johnson to protect educational and charitable 501c3 nonprofits
  from the quicksand of partisan politics, thus safeguarding the tax deductions
  for supporters and their ability to receive foundation and government grants.
  IRS guidance clearly stated that public 501c3 nonprofits may do any amount of
  voter registration and education, including helping people participate and
  vote, as long as they did so on a

<p>
  The nonprofit sector had largely left untapped their inherent capacity — as
  trusted messengers, deeply rooted in their local communities — to increase
  voter participation among the people they served and engaged. They have
  day-to-day personal contact with potential voters often missed by candidates
  and campaigns more narrowly focused on attracting already likely voters.
  What’s more, their non-partisan approach tends to work better with new voters
  seeking help and information.

<p>
  After a mid-career year at the Harvard Kennedy School focused on electoral
  reform, I had my first chance to work at a democracy organization, the
  Boston-based Commonwealth Coalition. The coalition, originally set up to help
  progressive reform-oriented candidates run for office, added three nonpartisan
  programs: one challenging the role of money in state politics, one encouraging
  people to vote in local elections, and the other to support women’s political
  leadership. In 1993, I was recruited to run the money and politics program.

<p>
  One of my first calls was from Emerson College student Malia Lazu, about her
  effort to hold a concert for democracy on Boston Common, the city’s downtown
  public park. Malia had heard about the concert I’d helped produce, headlined
  by Bob Marley, to benefit freedom movements in South Africa. When the city
  turned down her request for a permit because it feared problems with a
  multiracial audience, she volunteered to work for us at the coalition, and was
  soon directing the “Voter Power” initiative.
</p>
<p>
  We shared our disillusion with the state of politics, particularly its
  troubled history of racial bias. Too often, election outcomes were decided in
  primaries in districts designed to favor mostly white incumbents. On Election
  Day voters had few, if any, choices on the ballot, and too little reason to
  vote.
</p>
<p>
  Malia and I met with Boston nonprofit and foundation leaders about a pilot
  program specifically focused on training nonprofits to integrate nonpartisan
  voter and civic participation into programs they already offered. We hoped
  that this civic venture would bring higher turnout and might encourage more
  candidates to run, despite the odds, resulting in more competitive elections.

<p>
  Voter Power became Boston VOTE. Starting in Boston, we recruited a board of
  nonprofit leaders from the city’s lower turnout neighborhoods, including Kim
  Janey who, two decades later, would become the city’s first African-American
  and woman mayor — herself a reflection of a changing political landscape.
</p>
<p>
  Boston VOTE grew on the strength of its nonprofit outreach. By our second
  year, we had signed up more than 120 nonprofits serving the low turnout
  neighborhoods, including Dorchester, Roxbury, Mattapan, and Allston/Brighton.
  Boston VOTE reached out to service providers, neighborhood development
  organizations, advocacy organizations, community health centers, and the like
  to offer our nonpartisan voter engagement training.
</p>
<p>
  We made a special effort to engage youth through our own Young Civic Leaders
  program which offered paid internships for high school students to work with
  local nonprofits and scheduled time to learn about lawmaking at the state
  house and city hall.

        >Taking on Racial Gerrymandering in Boston and other Cities:</strong
      >
      We weren&rsquo;t lawyers, and had no plans to make our first foray into
      voting rights with a lawsuit, but when confronted with evidence of racial
      gerrymandering we took on the challenge. We had recently decided to
      purchase newly available redistricting software in order to monitor the
      make-up of the new 2002 district lines which the legislature was about to
      draw for Congress and themselves. We invited an attorney from the Lawyers
      for Civil Rights Boston to help us discuss its impact on the Boston
      neighborhoods where we were working. The story became one of racial
      gerrymandering in Boston, a federal lawsuit by black voters, the
      indictment and disbarment of the House speaker and, ultimately, justice
      for the targeted communities. (For the full story.)

      We continued our collaboration with t he Lawyers Committee to challenge
      biased voting methods in Springfield and Lowell. For decades their
      winner-take-all at-large voting method allowed a small group of white
      voters to retain full control of the City Council and School Committee. As
      a result, voters in a few neighborhood wards determined the outcome of
      most all municipal seats, who got hired for city jobs, and which
      neighborhoods received services. In both cities, the plaintiffs we
      represented won their case for fair elections. (For more add link)
