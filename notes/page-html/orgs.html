  After ending my first job out of college as a tax preparer for H&R Block, a call from my mother about a youth-run foundation to support activism in San Francisco sparked the idea of organizing my peers to try the same in Boston.
</p>
<p>
  I had learned something about organizing from my activist mom who on most days could be found at her desk planning events or raising money for her favorite causes and candidates. I’d also picked up some organizing principles volunteering evenings after a day of H$R Block at a free tax clinic sponsored by Chelsea Fair Share. Fair Share’s leaders, Mark and Barbara Splain, taught me the value offering a service as part of earning trust and providing a chance to meet people who might join your cause. In their case an organization to build power among Chelsea’s low-income residents. It was a lesson I took with me for the rest of my career.

  Having grown up more as a volunteer than a leader of campaigns, my first organizing project was the Haymarket People’s Fund. I started out with advice from local faith programs that made grants to community empowerment projects. Their unique approach included actively engaging members of the community in awarding the grants. At that time, I was studying for a master’s degree in American Studies at Goddard College. My final paper became a blueprint for creating a foundation. The Goddard course also inspired the its name, one that mixed the activist history I’d learned about the Haymarket Chicago protest for the eight-hour workday and Boston’s iconic 300-year-old Haymarket food market.

<p>
  I followed the plan I created with my course instructor Steve Miller. First to explore how Boston foundations of the era worked, from the family foundations of the Cabot and Saltonstalls to the liberal churches and the social justice collaborative Resist. Then to meet with groups they suggested to explore the community organizing around Boston and eventually all of New England. All this became possible with my first hire, the wise and spirted Janet Axelrod and first full-time volunteer – my look alike twin to the outside world, David Crocker, assumed go to be heir to the “Betty Crocker” fortune, the made up brand of, Pillsbury’s competitor in the flour business.
</p>
<p>
  Haymarket and the other alternative community funds that would form across the country sought to create a new generation of donors to support social change philanthropy. Under the banner of “Change not Charity,” we looked to invest in local organizations addressing the root causes of problems and taking steps towards more systemic and lasting solutions for the issues of the day. We hoped that our grants would give these local nonprofits the visibility and credibility that often results from association with the more established foundations. 
</p>
<p>
  Among those with inherited wealth that came of age in the social movements of the ’60s and ’70s, there was interest in funding those movements—but given the desire of many to remain anonymous, the challenge was to find them. I remembered the strategy of first offering a service, and found success in organizing gatherings for people with family wealth, providing a safe environment to discuss the personal issues related to coming into such wealth, including the impact on relationships, concerns about where their money came from, and how to have a conversation with their families or financial gatekeepers about using it to support activism.
</p>
<p>
  Haymarket held its first local donor meetings in 1974 in partnership with the American Friends Service Committee. The Quaker network’s own donors had also asked for a personal retreat like this, with the assurances that the meeting would be private and free of fundraising. National gatherings began when our mentor, David Hunter of the Stern Family Fund, convened the donors he advised. Over time, the private meetings grew and would come to include activist leaders and guests who could offer their perspectives on social impact grantmaking. Through our formative years, we sponsored similar workshops and retreats—locally and nationally—that generated like-minded initiatives supporting a national trend towards social change grantmaking.

</figure>

<p>
  Along with the change in the types of grants came a shift in decision-making power. We broke from the private trustee model of grantmaking, where grants were approved by a board of family members or related legal and financial professionals, administered by a family office, opting instead for funding boards that would reflect the issues and communities where the grants were being made. It seemed more effective to have local leaders with grassroots organizing experience lead the process, and more in line with our values to have the process itself be an extension of community empowerment.
</p>
<p>
  Haymarket’s founding board included activists like clerical worker Karen Nussbaum, who founded the organization 9to5, later made famous by the movie of the same name and Dolly Parton song; Walter Porter, Chair of the Boston association for minority firefighters; Robert Zevin, a lifelong activist and pioneer in the field of socially responsible investing; and Ann Froines, an advocate for women leaders. This model gave activists the opportunity to be grant makers Other public foundations with a similar mission soon adopted this approach.

      In another break with traditional philanthropy, we went public. Because we were new and had to find new donors to join in our cause, we turned to marketing and outreach. In lieu of TV ads and the Internet, we gained recognition by having a presence at foundation gatherings, as well as publishing Robin Hood Was Right, inspired and edited by author Adam Hochschild. The book, published in 1977, featured our funds and attracted a national audience with appearances on the Oprah Winfrey and Phil Donahue shows and coverage from the New York Times to Parade magazine, Esquire, and The Wall Street Journal, and more.

<p>
  In the wake of the publicity, young donors started 15 similar community foundations in areas like Atlanta, New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, and one in Los Angeles, Liberty Hill Foundation, founded by my sister Sarah Pillsbury. As we grew, it became clear that we would benefit from an association. Therefore, we created a national consortium called the Funding Exchange to support the growth of the local funds and to advance the conversation with other foundations around social change philanthropy.
</p>
<hr style="display:block; margin-bottom: 40px; text-align:center;" />
<p>
  This is not the history of a single foundation. It is the story of many similar efforts that built a movement to reshape philanthropy and create a community of foundations that shared a common social justice mission. Together we promoted the benefits of strategic grantmaking that sought to advance, over time, longer-term systemic approaches to the issues of the day.

<h2 id="voter-engagement">Voter Engagement and Voting Rights</h2>
<p>
Among the foundations and nonprofits, I worked with, it was often said that
the resources they had were only a fraction of what government could
potentially provide.
</p>
<p>
The long-term success of any nonprofit organization depended on a partnership
with a responsive government, both representative and accountable to the
communities they served. In other words, a healthy and functioning democracy.
</p>
<p>
In the 1990s, this trend was going in the wrong direction. Voter turnout
hovered at historic lows. More than half of eligible voters didn’t vote in
midterms, and even fewer voted in local elections. Most of the absent voters
were low-income, young, or first time voters new to the political process.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
If the nonprofit sector wanted to strengthen democracy and have their voices
heard, one way was to help the people they served to vote.
</p>
<p>
However, at the time many nonprofits mistakenly believed that their charitable
status meant they couldn’t talk to their clients and constituents about
voting. The IRS never said that. The Treasury Department only said in a single
sentence that 501c3 nonprofits, which most nonprofits are, cannot support or
oppose candidates for public office. A sentence was added in the 1950s by then
Senator Lyndon Johnson to protect educational and charitable 501c3 nonprofits
from the quicksand of partisan politics, thus safeguarding the tax deductions
for supporters and their ability to receive foundation and government grants.
IRS guidance clearly stated that public 501c3 nonprofits may do any amount of
voter registration and education, including helping people participate and
vote, as long as they did so on a

The nonprofit sector had largely left untapped their inherent capacity — as
trusted messengers, deeply rooted in their local communities — to increase
voter participation among the people they served and engaged. They have
day-to-day personal contact with potential voters often missed by candidates
and campaigns more narrowly focused on attracting already likely voters.
What’s more, their non-partisan approach tends to work better with new voters
seeking help and information.

<h3 id="bostonvote">BostonVOTE, MassVOTE</h3>
<p>
After a mid-career year at the Harvard Kennedy School focused on electoral
reform, I had my first chance to work at a democracy organization, the
Boston-based Commonwealth Coalition. The coalition, originally set up to help
progressive reform-oriented candidates run for office, added three nonpartisan
programs: one challenging the role of money in state politics, one encouraging
people to vote in local elections, and the other to support women’s political
leadership. In 1993, I was recruited to run the money and politics program.

<p>
One of my first calls was from Emerson College student Malia Lazu, about her
effort to hold a concert for democracy on Boston Common, the city’s downtown
public park. Malia had heard about the concert I’d helped produce, headlined
by Bob Marley, to benefit freedom movements in South Africa. When the city
turned down her request for a permit because it feared problems with a
multiracial audience, she volunteered to work for us at the coalition, and was
soon directing the “Voter Power” initiative.
</p>
<p>
We shared our disillusion with the state of politics, particularly its
troubled history of racial bias. Too often, election outcomes were decided in
primaries in districts designed to favor mostly white incumbents. On Election
Day voters had few, if any, choices on the ballot, and too little reason to
vote.
</p>
<p>
Malia and I met with Boston nonprofit and foundation leaders about a pilot
program specifically focused on training nonprofits to integrate nonpartisan
voter and civic participation into programs they already offered. We hoped
that this civic venture would bring higher turnout and might encourage more
candidates to run, despite the odds, resulting in more competitive elections.

<p>
Voter Power became Boston VOTE. Starting in Boston, we recruited a board of
nonprofit leaders from the city’s lower turnout neighborhoods, including Kim
Janey who, two decades later, would become the city’s first African-American
and woman mayor — herself a reflection of a changing political landscape.
</p>
<p>
Boston VOTE grew on the strength of its nonprofit outreach. By our second
year, we had signed up more than 120 nonprofits serving the low turnout
neighborhoods, including Dorchester, Roxbury, Mattapan, and Allston/Brighton.
Boston VOTE reached out to service providers, neighborhood development
organizations, advocacy organizations, community health centers, and the like
to offer our nonpartisan voter engagement training.
</p>
<p>
We made a special effort to engage youth through our own Young Civic Leaders
program which offered paid internships for high school students to work with
local nonprofits and scheduled time to learn about lawmaking at the state
house and city hall.

    <strong>Taking on Racial Gerrymandering in Boston and other Cities:</strong>
    We weren&rsquo;t lawyers, and had no plans to make our first foray into
    voting rights with a lawsuit, but when confronted with evidence of racial
    gerrymandering in Boston we took on the challenge. We had recently decided to
    purchase newly available redistricting software in order to monitor the
    make-up of the new 2002 district lines which the legislature was about to
    draw for Congress and themselves. We invited an attorney from the Lawyers
    for Civil Rights Boston to help us discuss its impact on the Boston
    neighborhoods where we were working. The story became one of racial
    gerrymandering in Boston, a federal lawsuit by black voters, the
    indictment and disbarment of the House speaker and, ultimately, justice
    for the targeted communities. (For the full story)

    voters to retain full control of the City Council and School Committee. As
    a result, voters in a few neighborhoods determined the outcome of
    most all municipal seats, who got hired for city jobs, and which
    neighborhoods received services. In both cities, the plaintiffs we
    represented won their case for fair elections. (For more)

  I had no immediate plans to replicate the work MassVOTE in more states, but others did. In 2005 I was approached by friends Marcia Avner and Jon Pratt of the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits, who ran a similar statewide program for their members.  They suggested we work together to create a national initiative that other states could join. It happened to coincide with a call from the San Francisco Tides Foundation’s Catalina Ruiz-Healy, offering MassVOTE $50,000 to start similar initiatives in Oakland and other cities and states. This was followed by another grant, again unsolicited, from the Funding Exchange to do the same in New Mexico and Pittsburgh.

  What soon made it possible to reach out to the nonprofit sector nationally was a $100,000 renewable grant from Geri Mannion, Managing Director of Strengthening U.S. Democracy at the Carnegie Corporation of New York. Geri had long wanted a national initiative to tap into what she saw as the “sleeping giant” of the growing nonprofit sector to increase voter turnout among underrepresented communities and strengthen democracy. She believed, as we did, that harnessing the everyday contact that community-based nonprofits had with people less likely to vote could increase their likelihood to vote and to encourage their family and friends to do the same.

  With offices in Minnesota and Boston, we reached out to other state nonprofit convenors to see if they’d join what we then called the <strong>Nonprofit Voter Engagement Network</strong> or <strong>NVEN</strong>. At the same time, we started to develop a strategy for what it would take to reach and engage a national audience.
</p>
<h5 id="state-partners">State Partners</h5>
<p>
  Nonprofit associations in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, Maine, and Louisiana were among the first to join NVEN, followed by nonprofit networks in Arizona and Greater Pittsburgh. We began to hold annual meetings for members to hone our trainings and to strategize how we could grow the network nationally. Among the most memorable was the 2008 meeting held in New Orleans. We were inspired not only by the city’s ongoing fight to recover from Hurricane Katrina, but by our irrepressible state host, Ashley Herad of the Louisiana Alliance for Nonprofits. Throughout the retreat, as we moved through the city’s streets, she made us circle up and take a knee to double our commitment to move forward.

<p>
  As more states came on board, a diverse subset of state partners joined a field program to evaluate our approach and impact. Each partner identified and managed a cohort of local community-based nonprofits to register voters and collect voter pledge cards onsite or at their events. They would track who registered and/or signed a pledge to vote. The data allowed us to measure our impact and draw lessons to share in our webinars and trainings.

  engagement into their communications strategies and to promote our monthly

  In 2012, Nonprofit VOTE joined the leading nonpartisan voter registration organizations to establish National Voter Registration Day. Celebrated on the fourth Tuesday of every September, it quickly gained momentum as a nonpartisan civic holiday celebrating our democracy. Each year, organizations, volunteers, and local election offices “hit the streets”—online and in the field—in a single day of coordinated field, technology, and media efforts. Support for the day comes from the largest nonpartisan registration groups as well as media companies like Google, Reddit, MTV, Tumblr, and Facebook, and thousands of grassroots community partners.  Along with the sponsors, 4,589 community partners signed up in 2020, recruiting 31,474 volunteers to conduct drives and stage events.  That year, more than 1.6 million voters registered or updated their registration on National Voter Registration Day.

<h4 id="trainings-and-resources">Trainings and Resources</h4>
<h5 id="the-trainings">The Trainings</h5>
<p>
  When we started, most nonprofits lacked practical advice on what they could do to help people vote and educate candidates on their issues. Our web and in-person trainings clarified the ban on partisan activities, like endorsing a candidate or telling people who to vote for. They then highlighted the <a href="https://www.nonprofitvote.org/resource/staying-nonpartisan-permissible-election-activities-checklist-2/" title="Staying Nonpartisan Permissible Election Activities Checklist 2" >common nonpartisan activities</a> nonprofits could undertake around elections to help people participate and vote.
</p>

<p>
  The trainings would also feature the benefits of doing voter engagement for the nonprofit and communities they served, and strategies to help them imagine how they could integrate this into their ongoing services and outreach without inventing another program.
</p>

<h5 id="the-resources">The Resources</h5>
<p>
  Perhaps my greatest contribution in my years at Nonprofit VOTE was creating
  the basic materials and resources that became the foundation of our guidance
  and trainings. I had help from leading experts in the field, most
  notably our attorney

  The Evaluation of Impact: Measuring How Nonprofits Help People Vote
</h4>
<p>
  Every year, Nonprofit VOTE sees an increase in the number of nonprofits accessing our resources and signing up for its trainings, with resulting increases in voter engagement in those communities. A 2021 survey by the Urban Institute (see "<a href="https://www.nonprofitvote.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Americas-Nonprofits-Get-Out-The-Vote_.pdf" title="America's Nonprofits Get Out the Vote">America's Nonprofits Get Out the Vote</a>" for more) found that one in five of the nation’s 875,000 registered nonprofits now offer voter registration and education.

<p>
  It’s important to also learn more about who they are reaching and if it is helping increase voter participation. To find out, starting in 2012, Nonprofit VOTE enlisted a diverse set of state partners to manage a cohort of local nonprofits to track their voter engagement.
</p>
<p>
  The participating nonprofits logged the people they registered to vote or who
  signed a voter pledge card and discussed their plan to vote. State voter files
  allowed us to do an independent analysis of the demographics and turnout rates
  of those we contacted to all other registered voters in the same area. The
  findings have consistently shown:

<p>
  Our partners were also interested in turnout trends and the impact of election policies.  Has voter turnout gone up? What states are highest and what states are lowest?</p>
  <p>
    After our first national election in 2006, Nonprofit VOTE partnered with the <a href="http://www.electproject.org/" title="US Elections Project">U. S. Elections Project</a>, the official source of state and national turnout, to research and publish "<a href="https://www.nonprofitvote.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/america-goes-polls-2020-7.pdf" title="America Goes to the Polls 2020">America Goes to the Polls</a>." The report, issued after each national presidential or mid-term election, tracks the change in national turnout over time. It ranks the 50 states in percentage of voter turnout and correlates that to state election policies.  (<a href="https://www.nonprofitvote.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/america-goes-polls-2018.pdf" title="AGTP 2018">2018</a> and <a href="https://www.nonprofitvote.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/america-goes-polls-2020-7.pdf" title="AGTP 2020">2020</a> editions).
  </p>
    <p>
      In every national election, the most consistent finding has been the wide differences in voter turnout between states that make it easier or harder to vote. Voter turnout is 10-20 points lower in the states that cut off voter registration four weeks before the election and/or make it harder to use mail ballots or early voting. In contrast, states with the highest turnout have same-day voter registration and convenient options to vote early.

    </p>

    <h4 id="moving-forward">
      Moving Forward
    </h4>
<p>
  Recently, in spite of restrictive voting laws and a pandemic, voter turnout reached its highest level in 100 years in the 2018 midterm and 2020 presidential election. The reaction to a polarizing president was one reason. Greater mobilization and turnout among voters often overlooked by campaigns was another. MassVOTE and Nonprofit VOTE were glad to be part of this, along with their partners and other similar efforts dedicated to helping people register and vote.
</p>
<p>
  Record turnout has brought a new wave of partisan laws in states with a history of voter suppression, to make it harder to vote. Organizations like Nonprofit VOTE and MassVOTE will continue to support community-based efforts to help people navigate any added restrictions meant to disenfranchise voters. 
</p>
<p>
  At the same time our partners advocate not only to vote but also for elections policies that reflect the fundamental principles of what it means to be a democracy - like the ten policies featured in the on our <a href="/democracys-top-ten" title="Democracy's Top Ten">Democracy's Top Ten</a> page. Time-tested policies almost every advance democracy has in some form, as do many of our states.
</p>
<p>

  My greatest lesson from my first 25 years in philanthropy supporting positive social change is that we as a nation can’t address the larger social and economic challenges without an actual representative democracy. One that better represents what is most often popular support for positive progress on the issues of the day. Also, where political polarization is baked into our two-party system by our long outdated winner take all plurality voting method.  A two party duopoly That does as much as money and in politics or anything else to prevent state and federal government from finding common ground or advancing common sense, popular solutions.  Ones that don’t have to solve every problem at once, but do enough to move forward and build on.
