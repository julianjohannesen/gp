<p>
  After ending my first job out of college as a tax preparer for H&amp;R Block,
  a call from my mother about a youth-run foundation to support activism in San
  Francisco sparked the idea of organizing my peers to try the same in Boston.
</p>
<p>
  I had learned something about organizing from my activist mom. I&rsquo;d also
  picked up some organizing principles volunteering evenings at a free tax
  clinic sponsored by Chelsea Fair Share. Its leaders,
  <a href="https://forgeorganizing.org/article/best-action-ever"
      >Mark and Barbara Splain</a
      >, taught me the value of offering a service as part of earning trust and a
  chance to meet people who might join your cause. In their case an organization
  to build power among Chelsea&rsquo;s low-income residents. It was a lesson I
  took with me for the rest of my career.

<p>
  Having grown up more as a volunteer than a leader of campaigns, my first
  organizing project was the Haymarket People&rsquo;s Fund. I started with
  advice from local faith programs that already made grants to community
  empowerment projects. Their unique approach included actively engaging members
  of the community in the awarding of grants. From there, I drafted a plan to
  create a foundation as my final paper for a degree in American Studies from
  Goddard College, where I had been studying. The course would also provide the
  name, a cross between the historic Haymarket Chicago protest for the
  eight-hour workday and Boston&rsquo;s 300-year-old food market, with the same
  name.

</figure>
<p>
  Haymarket and the other alternative community funds that would form across the
  country sought to create a new generation of donors to support social change
  philanthropy. Under the banner of &ldquo;Change not Charity,&rdquo; we looked
  to invest in local organizations addressing the root causes of problems and
  taking steps towards more systemic and lasting solutions for the issues of the
  day. We hoped our grants would give visibility and credibility that could
  result in funding from the more established foundations. Often that was the
  case.
</p>
<p>
  Among those with inherited wealth that came of age in the social movements of
  the &rsquo;60s and &rsquo;70s, there was interest in funding those
  movements&mdash;but many of them wanted anonymity, so the challenge was to
  find them. In line with the idea of first offering a service, we found success
  in organizing gatherings for people with family wealth; offering a safe
  environment to discuss the personal issues related to coming into inherited
  wealth. A place to talk about impact on relationships, concerns about where
  their money came from, and how to have a conversation with their families or
  financial gatekeepers about using it to support activism.
</p>
<p>
  Haymarket had its first local donor meetings in partnership with the American
  Friends Service Committee. The Quaker network&rsquo;s own donors had also
  asked for a personal retreat like this. It was established that the meeting
  had the assurance of anonymity and there would be no fundraising on site.
  National gatherings began when our mentor, David Hunter of the Stern Family
  Fund, convened the donors he advised to meet on a personal basis. Over time,
  the private meetings grew and moved to different locations around the country.
  These meetings would come to include activist leaders and guests who could
  offer their perspectives on social impact grantmaking. Through our formative
  years, we sponsored workshops and retreats like this&mdash;locally and
  nationally&mdash;that generated spin-offs and like-minded initiatives that
  supported a national trend to social change grantmaking.

</figure>
<p>
  Along with the change in the kind of grants made came a shift in power of who
  made them. We made a break from the private trustee model of grantmaking,
  where grants were approved by a board of family members or related legal and
  financial professionals, administered by a family office. We opted instead to
  have funding boards reflect the issues and communities where the grants were
  being made. It seemed more effective to have local leaders with grassroots
  organizing experience lead the process, and it was more in line with our
  values to have the grantmaking process itself be an extension of community
  empowerment.
</p>
<p>
  In forming Haymarket&rsquo;s founding board, we included activists like
  clerical worker Karen Nussbaum, who founded the organization 9to5, later made
  famous by the movie of the same name and
  <a href="https://www.biography.com/news/dolly-parton-9-to-5-theme-song"
      >Dolly Parton song</a
      >. Another member was Walter Porter, the community-based chair of a Boston
  association for minority firefighters. Robert Zevin, a lifelong activist and
  pioneer in the field of socially responsible investing, was also involved. Ann
  Froines, advocate for women leaders, joined our board. This model gave
  activists the opportunity to be donors, and donors a chance to engage with
  those they supported. Other public foundations like ours that started later
  with a similar mission also opted for this approach.

  In another break with traditional philanthropy, we went public. At the time
  only the United Way had TV ads and no one had a website. Because we were new
  and had to find new donors to join in our cause, we turned to marketing and
  outreach. It meant having a presence at foundation gatherings. It gave birth
  to the publication
  <a

      >Robin Hood Was Right</a
      >, inspired by and edited by author Adam Hochschild. The book, published in
  1977 featured our funds and attracted a national audience with appearances on
  the Oprah Winfrey and Phil Donahue shows and coverage from the New York Times
  to Parade magazine, Town and Country, and others.

<p>
  In the wake of the publicity, young donors started 15 similar community
  foundations in areas like Atlanta, New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, and one in
  Los Angeles,
  <a href="https://www.libertyhill.org/who-we-are/about-us/#Our-History"
      >Liberty Hill Foundation</a
      >, founded by my sister Sarah Pillsbury. As we grew, it became clear that we
  would benefit from an association. We created a national consortium called the
  <a href="https://fex.org/">Funding Exchange</a> to support the growth of the
  local funds and to advance the conversation with other foundations around
  social change philanthropy.
</p>
<hr style="display:block; margin-bottom: 40px; text-align:center;" />
<p>
  This is not the history of a single foundation. It is the story of many
  similar efforts that built a movement to reshape philanthropy and build a
  community of foundations that shared a common social justice mission. Together
  we promoted the benefits of strategic grantmaking that sought to promote
  longer-term systemic approaches to the issues of the day.

<h2 id="voter-engagement">Voter Engagement and Voting Rights</h2>
<p>
  Among the foundations and nonprofits I worked with, it was often said that the
  money they had to address social issues was only a fraction of what government
  could do.
</p>
<p>
  The long-term success of these organizations depended on a partnership with
  responsive government representatives who were accountable to the communities
  they served. In other words, a healthy and functioning democracy.
</p>
<p>
  In the 1990s, this trend was going in the wrong direction. Voter turnout
  hovered at historic lows. More than half of eligible voters didn&rsquo;t vote
  in midterms and fewer in local elections, most notably voters that were
  low-income, young, or relatively new citizens.
</p>
<p>
  If the nonprofit sector wanted to strengthen democracy and have their voices
  heard, it had to do its part to make sure that the people they served voted.
</p>
<p>
  Most nonprofits, however, mistakenly believed that their charitable status
  meant they couldn&rsquo;t talk to their clients and constituents about voting.
  While private foundations faced some limitations, the IRS clearly stated that
  all public 501c3 charities could do any amount of voter registration and
  education, including helping people participate and vote. As long as they did
  so on a

  The nonprofit sector had largely left untapped their inherent capacity to
  increase voter participation among those voters with a history of low voter
  turnout. They are already trusted messengers, deeply rooted in their local
  communities. They have day-to-day personal contact with potential voters often
  missed by candidates and campaigns more narrowly focused on attracting already
  likely voters. What&rsquo;s more, their non-partisan approach tends to work
  better with new voters seeking the help and information needed to be a voter.

<h3 id="bostonvote">BostonVOTE, MassVOTE</h3>
<p>
  After a mid-career year at the Harvard Kennedy School focused on electoral
  reform, I had my first chance to work at a democracy organization, the Boston
  based Commonwealth Coalition. The coalition, originally set up to help
  progressive reform-oriented candidates run for office, added programs
  challenging the role of money in state politics and encouraging people to vote
  in local elections. I was recruited to run the money and politics program.

<p>
  One of my first calls was from an Emerson College student, Malia Lazu, about
  her effort to hold a concert for democracy on the Boston Common, the
  city&rsquo;s downtown public park. Malia had heard about the benefit concert,
  headlined by Bob Marley, for liberation movements in Southern Africa that I
  helped produce while working at Haymarket foundation. When the city turned
  down her request for a permit because it feared problems with a multiracial
  audience, she volunteered to work for democracy at the Coalition, and was soon
  directing the &ldquo;Voter Power&rdquo; initiative.
</p>
<p>
  We shared our disillusion with the state of politics. Particularly its
  troubled history of racial bias, where election outcomes were decided in
  primaries in districts designed to favor mostly white incumbents. On Election
  Day voters had few, if any, choices on the ballot, and too little reason to
  vote.
</p>
<p>
  Malia and I met with Boston nonprofit and foundation leaders about a pilot
  program specifically focused on training nonprofits to integrate voter and
  civic participation into programs they already offered on a nonpartisan basis.
  A civic venture we hoped would bring higher turnout and might encourage more
  candidates to run, despite the odds, making elections more competitive.

<p>
  Voter Power became <strong>Boston VOTE</strong>. Starting in Boston, it
  recruited a board of nonprofit leaders from 18 of its lower turnout
  neighborhoods. One was Kim Janey who, two decades later, would become the
  city&rsquo;s first African-American and woman mayor, herself a reflection of a
  changing Boston.
</p>
<p>
  By our second year we had signed up more than 120 nonprofits serving the low
  turnout neighborhoods. Boston VOTE reached out to service providers,
  neighborhood development organizations, advocacy organizations, community
  health centers and the like. Each nonprofit received voter engagement training
  focused on voter registration, helping people become voters, and strategies to
  integrate voter outreach into ongoing programs while remaining nonpartisan.

<p>
  Boston VOTE grew on the strength of its nonprofit outreach and these early
  partners that developed their own voter engagement initiatives, including

  voters to retain full control of the City Council and School Committee. As
  a result, voters in a few neighborhood wards determined the outcome of
  most all municipal seats, who got hired for city jobs, and which
  neighborhoods received services. In both cities, the plaintiffs we
  represented won their case for fair elections. (For more add link)

<p>
  In 2005, it was not my intention to nationally replicate what MassVOTE had
  done in Massachusetts. The idea came from the Minnesota Council of
  Nonprofits&rsquo; Marcia Avner and Jon Pratt, who had run a similar program
  the year before. The timing worked well. At the same time, Catalina
  Ruiz-Healy, of the San Francisco Tides Foundation, gave MassVOTE an
  unsolicited grant of $50,000 to start similar initiatives in Oakland and other
  states. A similar grant came from a donor at the Funding Exchange to support
  nonprofit-led voter outreach in New Mexico and Pittsburgh.

  What soon made it possible to reach out to the nonprofit sector nationally was
  a $100,000 renewable grant from Geri Mannion, Managing Director of
  Strengthening U.S. Democracy at the Carnegie Corporation foundation. Geri,
  already a supporter of the MN Council of Nonprofits, had long wanted an
  initiative to tap into what she saw as the &ldquo;sleeping giant&rdquo; of the
  growing nonprofit sector to increase voter turnout among underrepresented
  communities and strengthen democracy. She believed, as we did, that harnessing
  the everyday contact that community-based nonprofits had with people less
  likely to vote could increase their likelihood to vote and encourage their
  family and friends to do the same.
</p>
<h4 id="activating">Activating the Nonprofit Sector</h4>
<p>
  With offices in Minnesota and Boston, we reached out to other state
  nonprofit convenors to see if they&rsquo;d join what we then called the
  Nonprofit Voter Engagement Network or NVEN. At the same time, we started to
  develop a strategy for what it would take to reach and engage a national
  audience.
</p>
<h5 id="state-partners">State Partners</h5>
<p>
  Nonprofit associations in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, Maine, and Louisiana
  were among the first to join NVEN, followed by nonprofit networks in Arizona
  and Greater Pittsburgh. Every year, NVEN members started meeting yearly in a
  different state to hone our trainings and to strategize how we could grow the
  network nationally. Among the most memorable was the 2008 meeting held in New
  Orleans. We were inspired not only by the music and the city&rsquo;s ongoing
  fight to recover from Hurricane Katrina, but by our irrepressible state host,
  Ashley Herad of the Louisiana Alliance for Nonprofits who made us take a knee
  at any hint of indecision to move forward
</p>

</p>
<p>
  As more states joined, a geographically diverse subset of state partners
  joined a field program to evaluate our approach and impact. Each partner
  identified and managed a cohort of community-based nonprofits in their state
  to register voters and have them sign a pledge to vote onsite or at their
  events. They would track who registered and/or signed a pledge to vote. The
  data allowed us to measure our impact and learn lessons to share in our
  webinars and trainings.
</p>
<h5 id="national-partners">National Partners</h5>
<p>
  Soon, our first national networks began to join, led by the
  <a href="https://www.alliance1.org/"
      >Alliance for Strong Families and Communities</a>, a long-standing national
  network of settlement houses, neighborhood centers, human service agencies,
  and grassroots organizations focused on economic empowerment and
  neighborhood engagement. The second was the <a href="https://www.hcadvocacy.org/"
      >National Association of Community Health Clinics</a>. Initiated by its advocacy
  director, Marc Wetherhorn. It established the Community Health Vote Program,
  with voter engagement resources and guidance shared with its 1,200 community
  health centers. They were followed by national partners like Goodwill
  Industries, Feeding America, and YWCA, all agreeing to incorporate voter
  engagement into their communications strategies and to promote our monthly
  webinars and online resources to their local and state affiliates.
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Our national growth accelerated with the support of sector leaders like
  Tim Delaney and the
  <a href="https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/trends-policy-issues/protecting-nonprofit-nonpartisanship"
      >National Council of Nonprofits</a>, which convened state associations in the 50
  states, and Diana Aviv and the advocacy team at the <a href="https://independentsector.org/">Independent Sector (IS)</a>, with its membership of national nonprofit networks
  and foundations. It was at an IS conference that we met Steve Taylor, vice
  president of <a href="https://www.unitedway.org/">United Way Worldwide</a>. He asked us to create a voter engagement toolkit
  tailored for local United Ways. Their director of advocacy and policy,
  Lindsay Torrico, joined our leadership council. Sector convenors like the
  <a>Council on Foundations</a> and the Regional Associations of Grantmakers (now
  called the <a>United Philanthropy Forum</a>) also joined. We saw the results, as
  more of their affiliates signed up for a webinar training, joined us on
  National Voter Registration Day, and invited us to present at their national
  conference.

<h5 id="election-officials">Partnerships with Election Officials</h5>
<p>
  In 2009, we were invited by the
  <a href="https://www.nass.org/"
      >National Association of Secretaries of State</a> and soon after the <a href="https://www.nased.org/"
      >National Association of State Election Directors</a> to be an official partner
  for the nonprofit sector. Their staff and members valued the nonpartisan
  guidance and training we gave nonprofits. We found our commitment to
  nonpartisanship opened doors, not just to the Secretaries of State, but to a
  wide variety of state and national partnerships and initiatives &ndash; the
  largest of which was National Voter Registration Day, and how we became one
  of the event&rsquo;s founders and its primary manager.
  </a>
</p>
<h4 id="NVRD">National Voter Registration Day: A Celebration of Democracy</h4>
<p>
  In 2012, Nonprofit VOTE joined the leading nonpartisan voter registration
  organizations to establish National Voter Registration Day. Celebrated on the
  fourth Tuesday of every September, it quickly gained momentum as a nonpartisan
  civic holiday celebrating our democracy. Each year, organizations, volunteers,
  and local election offices &ldquo;hit the streets&rdquo;&mdash;online and in
  the field&mdash;in a single day of coordinated field, technology, and media
  efforts. Support for the day comes from the largest nonpartisan registration
  groups, including media companies like Google, Reddit, MTV, Tumblr, and
  Facebook, and thousands of grassroots community partners. In 2020, more than
  1.6 million voters registered or updated their registration on National Voter
  Registration Day. Along with the sponsors, 4,589 community partners signed up,
  recruiting 31,474 volunteers to conduct drives and stage events.
</p>
<p>Now National Voter Registration Day started. (Insert Link here)</p>
<h4 id="trainings-and-resources">Trainings and Resources</h4>
<h5 id="the-trainings">The Trainings</h5>
<p>
  When we began, nonprofits mainly knew what they
  <em>couldn&rsquo;t do</em> around elections, but had little knowledge of what
  they <em>could do</em> on a nonpartisan basis to help people vote and educate
  candidates on their issues.
</p>
<figure>
  <blockquote>
      A 501(c)(3 tax-exempt organization may not intervene in any political
      campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public
      office.
  </blockquote>
  <figcaption>
      blah blah
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Our basic trainings explained the ban on partisan activities and when and how
  it started. The ban stems from a single sentence inserted into the tax code in
  1954 by then Senator Lyndon Johnson. Johnson did so
  <a
      href="https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/trends-policy-issues/protecting-nonprofit-nonpartisanship"
      >to protect 501c3 nonprofits</a> from the quicksand of partisan politics, thus
  safeguarding the tax deductions allowed for donations to charitable and
  educational nonprofits for the long run. The IRS has repeatedly stated the
  ban did not exclude any non-partisan activity.
</p>
<p>
  The trainings then highlighted the most common nonpartisan activities they
  could safely undertake, like voter registration, candidate forums, and
  reminders to vote. They also featured the benefits of voting for the nonprofit
  and the people they served, and offered strategies to help already busy
  organizations imagine how they could incorporate this work into their ongoing
  services, outreach, or events.
</p>
<h5 id="the-resources">The Resources</h5>
<p>
  Perhaps my greatest contribution in my years at Nonprofit VOTE was creating
  the stock materials and resources that became the foundation of our guidance
  and partner trainings. I had guidance from leading experts in the field, most
  notably our attorney
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-pomeranz-5719224/"
      >John Pomeranz</a>, and <a href="https://www.adlercolvin.com/gregory-l-colvin-2/"
      >Greg Colvin</a>, former co-chair of the American Bar Association Subcommittee
  on Political and Lobbying Activities of Exempt Organizations, as well as
  from the bolder advocacy program of the Alliance for Justice. Our online
  resources and monthly web trainings are accessed by nonprofits year round in
  all 50 states.
</p>
<h5 id="the-evaluation-of-impact">
  The Evaluation of Impact: Measuring How Nonprofits Help People Vote
</h5>
<p>
  Every year, Nonprofit VOTE sees an increase in the number of nonprofits
  signing up for its trainings and voter engagement on site and in their
  community. A 2020 survey by the Urban Institute found that one in five of the
  nation&rsquo;s 875,000 registered nonprofits now do activities like voter
  registration and education.
</p>
<p>
  But who are they reaching and is it helping increase voter participation? To
  find out, starting in 2012, Nonprofit VOTE enlisted a diverse set of state
  partners to manage a cohort of community-based nonprofits to track their voter
  engagement.
</p>
<p>
  The participating nonprofits logged the people they registered to vote or who
  signed a voter pledge card and discussed their plan to vote. State voter files
  allowed us to do an independent analysis of the demographics and turnout rates
  of those we contacted to all other registered voters in the same area. The
  findings have consistently shown:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
      <p>
          The people the nonprofits reach are disproportionately younger (ages
          18-25), lower income, and black, hispanic, or of color.
      </p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
          T he voter turnout for those we contacted varies from 5-15 points higher
          for the nonprofit voters, compared to all others. Nonprofits have had
          their largest impact on raising turnout in midterms.
      </p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
          Turnout increases are highest among those least expected to vote, based on
          their demographics and voting history.
      </p>
  </li>
</ol>
