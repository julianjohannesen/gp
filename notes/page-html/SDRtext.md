# Same Day Registration
In every national election several million voters are unable to vote due to a problem with their voter registration. One group of such would-be voters includes young voters, first-time voters, and those who recently moved and missed their state’s deadline to register - deadlines that are often set weeks in advance of the election, leaving out many voters who don’t decide to vote until days before the election.

A larger group includes already registered voters who are turned away at the polls due to a fixable error in their registration, and already registered voters who were incorrectly purged from the voter registration rolls. Among millions of new or updated registrations, mistakes will are inevitably made by a clerk, third party registration drive, government agency, or the voter. Purges done to clean the state voter rolls can accidently or over aggressively removing inevitably many who’s registration is valid. 

## How it Works
Same day registration, also known as Election Day registration, is a time-tested policy of over 40 years. It allows voters with valid ID and proof of residency to register or update their registration when they vote on Election Day or during the early voting period Today there is no reason any state should let a fixable registration issue prevent citizens of voting age from voting. 23 States and Washington DC have Same Day Registration.

## Benefits
No voter is turned away by fixable voter registration issues. Voters still have a chance to register or correct a mistake in a previous registration when they vote. This is especially beneficial for first-time voters.

It Increases accuracy of registration rolls. Unlike registrations mailed in or done online, same day registrations are done in person by trained election officials
Saves the added cost of and uncertainty of provisional ballots now used for voters not properly on the list.

This time-tested policy of 40 years has long been cited in political science research as likely to increase voter turnout by three to seven percentage points once implemented, even after controlling for other factors.
