<h2>Nonprofit VOTE</h2>
<h3>In the Beginning</h3>
<p>
  In 2005, it was not my intention to nationally replicate what MassVOTE had
  done in Massachusetts. The idea came from the Minnesota Council of
  Nonprofits&rsquo; Marcia Avner and Jon Pratt, who had run a similar program
  the year before. The timing worked well. At the same time, Catalina
  Ruiz-Healy, of the San Francisco Tides Foundation, gave MassVOTE an
  unsolicited grant of $50,000 to start similar initiatives in Oakland and other
  states. A similar grant came from a donor at the Funding Exchange to support
  nonprofit-led voter outreach in New Mexico and Pittsburgh.

  What soon made it possible to reach out to the nonprofit sector nationally was
  a $100,000 renewable grant from Geri Mannion, Managing Director of
  Strengthening U.S. Democracy at the Carnegie Corporation foundation. Geri,
  already a supporter of the MN Council of Nonprofits, had long wanted an
  initiative to tap into what she saw as the &ldquo;sleeping giant&rdquo; of the
  growing nonprofit sector to increase voter turnout among underrepresented
  communities and strengthen democracy. She believed, as we did, that harnessing
  the everyday contact that community-based nonprofits had with people less
  likely to vote could increase their likelihood to vote and encourage their
  family and friends to do the same.
</p>
<h3>Activating the Nonprofit Sector</h3>
<p>
  With offices in Minnesota and Boston, we reached out to other state
  nonprofit convenors to see if they&rsquo;d join what we then called the
  Nonprofit Voter Engagement Network or NVEN. At the same time, we started to
  develop a strategy for what it would take to reach and engage a national
  audience.
</p>
<h4>State Partners</h4>
<p>
  Nonprofit associations in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, Maine, and Louisiana
  were among the first to join NVEN, followed by nonprofit networks in Arizona
  and Greater Pittsburgh. Every year, NVEN members started meeting yearly in a
  different state to hone our trainings and to strategize how we could grow the
  network nationally. Among the most memorable was the 2008 meeting held in New
  Orleans. We were inspired not only by the music and the city&rsquo;s ongoing
  fight to recover from Hurricane Katrina, but by our irrepressible state host,
  Ashley Herad of the Louisiana Alliance for Nonprofits who made us take a knee
  at any hint of indecision to move forward
</p>

</p>
<p>
  As more states joined, a geographically diverse subset of state partners
  joined a field program to evaluate our approach and impact. Each partner
  identified and managed a cohort of community-based nonprofits in their state
  to register voters and have them sign a pledge to vote onsite or at their
  events. They would track who registered and/or signed a pledge to vote. The
  data allowed us to measure our impact and learn lessons to share in our
  webinars and trainings.
</p>
<h4>National Partners</h4>
<p>
  Soon, our first national networks began to join, led by the
  <a href="https://www.alliance1.org/"
    >Alliance for Strong Families and Communities</a>, a long-standing national
    network of settlement houses, neighborhood centers, human service agencies,
    and grassroots organizations focused on economic empowerment and
    neighborhood engagement. The second was the <a href="https://www.hcadvocacy.org/"
    >National Association of Community Health Clinics</a>. Initiated by its advocacy
    director, Marc Wetherhorn. It established the Community Health Vote Program,
    with voter engagement resources and guidance shared with its 1,200 community
    health centers. They were followed by national partners like Goodwill
    Industries, Feeding America, and YWCA, all agreeing to incorporate voter
    engagement into their communications strategies and to promote our monthly
    webinars and online resources to their local and state affiliates.
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Our national growth accelerated with the support of sector leaders like
  Tim Delaney and the
  <a href="https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/trends-policy-issues/protecting-nonprofit-nonpartisanship"
    >National Council of Nonprofits</a>, which convened state associations in the 50
    states, and Diana Aviv and the advocacy team at the <a href="https://independentsector.org/"
    >Independent Sector (IS)</a>, with its membership of national nonprofit networks
    and foundations. It was at an IS conference that we met Steve Taylor, vice
    president of <a href="https://www.unitedway.org/"
    >United Way Worldwide</a>. He asked us to create a voter engagement toolkit
    tailored for local United Ways. Their director of advocacy and policy,
    Lindsay Torrico, joined our leadership council. Sector convenors like the
    <a>Council on Foundations</a> and the Regional Associations of Grantmakers (now
    called the <a>United Philanthropy Forum</a>) also joined. We saw the results, as
    more of their affiliates signed up for a webinar training, joined us on
    National Voter Registration Day, and invited us to present at their national
    conference.

<h4>Partnerships with Election Officials</h4>
<p>
  In 2009, we were invited by the
  <a href="https://www.nass.org/"
    >National Association of Secretaries of State</a> and soon after the <a href="https://www.nased.org/"
    >National Association of State Election Directors</a> to be an official partner
    for the nonprofit sector. Their staff and members valued the nonpartisan
    guidance and training we gave nonprofits. We found our commitment to
    nonpartisanship opened doors, not just to the Secretaries of State, but to a
    wide variety of state and national partnerships and initiatives &ndash; the
    largest of which was National Voter Registration Day, and how we became one
    of the event&rsquo;s founders and its primary manager.

<h3>National Voter Registration Day: A Celebration of Democracy</h3>
<p>
  In 2012, Nonprofit VOTE joined the leading nonpartisan voter registration
  organizations to establish National Voter Registration Day. Celebrated on the
  fourth Tuesday of every September, it quickly gained momentum as a nonpartisan
  civic holiday celebrating our democracy. Each year, organizations, volunteers,
  and local election offices &ldquo;hit the streets&rdquo;&mdash;online and in
  the field&mdash;in a single day of coordinated field, technology, and media
  efforts. Support for the day comes from the largest nonpartisan registration
  groups, including media companies like Google, Reddit, MTV, Tumblr, and
  Facebook, and thousands of grassroots community partners. In 2020, more than
  1.6 million voters registered or updated their registration on National Voter
  Registration Day. Along with the sponsors, 4,589 community partners signed up,
  recruiting 31,474 volunteers to conduct drives and stage events.
</p>
<p>Now National Voter Registration Day started. (Insert Link here)</p>
<h3>Trainings and Resources</h3>
<h3>The Trainings</h3>
<p>
  When we began, nonprofits mainly knew what they
  <em>couldn&rsquo;t do</em> around elections, but had little knowledge of what
  they <em>could do</em> on a nonpartisan basis to help people vote and educate
  candidates on their issues.
</p>
<figure>
    <blockquote>
        A 501(c)(3 tax-exempt organization may not intervene in any political
        campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public
        office.
    </blockquote>
    <figcaption>
        blah blah
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Our basic trainings explained the ban on partisan activities and when and how
  it started. The ban stems from a single sentence inserted into the tax code in
  1954 by then Senator Lyndon Johnson. Johnson did so
  <a
    href="https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/trends-policy-issues/protecting-nonprofit-nonpartisanship"
    >to protect 501c3 nonprofits</a> from the quicksand of partisan politics, thus
    safeguarding the tax deductions allowed for donations to charitable and
    educational nonprofits for the long run. The IRS has repeatedly stated the
    ban did not exclude any non-partisan activity.
</p>
<p>
  The trainings then highlighted the most common nonpartisan activities they
  could safely undertake, like voter registration, candidate forums, and
  reminders to vote. They also featured the benefits of voting for the nonprofit
  and the people they served, and offered strategies to help already busy
  organizations imagine how they could incorporate this work into their ongoing
  services, outreach, or events.
</p>
<h4>The Resources</h4>
<p>
  Perhaps my greatest contribution in my years at Nonprofit VOTE was creating
  the stock materials and resources that became the foundation of our guidance
  and partner trainings. I had guidance from leading experts in the field, most
  notably our attorney
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-pomeranz-5719224/"
    >John Pomeranz, and &lt;/a &gt;</a
  ><a href="https://www.adlercolvin.com/gregory-l-colvin-2/"
    >Greg Colvin, former co-chair of the American Bar Association Subcommittee
    on Political and Lobbying Activities of Exempt Organizations, as well as
    from the bolder advocacy program of the Alliance for Justice. Our online
    resources and monthly web trainings are accessed by nonprofits year round in
    all 50 states.

    >The Evaluation of Impact: Measuring How Nonprofits Help People Vote
  </strong>
</h4>
<p>
  Every year, Nonprofit VOTE sees an increase in the number of nonprofits
  signing up for its trainings and voter engagement on site and in their
  community. A 2020 survey by the Urban Institute found that one in five of the
  nation&rsquo;s 875,000 registered nonprofits now do activities like voter
  registration and education.
</p>
<p>
  But who are they reaching and is it helping increase voter participation? To
  find out, starting in 2012, Nonprofit VOTE enlisted a diverse set of state
  partners to manage a cohort of community-based nonprofits to track their voter
  engagement.
</p>
<p>
  The participating nonprofits logged the people they registered to vote or who
  signed a voter pledge card and discussed their plan to vote. State voter files
  allowed us to do an independent analysis of the demographics and turnout rates
  of those we contacted to all other registered voters in the same area. The
  findings have consistently shown:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      The people the nonprofits reach are disproportionately younger (ages
      18-25), lower income, and black, hispanic, or of color.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      T he voter turnout for those we contacted varies from 5-15 points higher
      for the nonprofit voters, compared to all others. Nonprofits have had
      their largest impact on raising turnout in midterms.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Turnout increases are highest among those least expected to vote, based on
      their demographics and voting history.
