## Election Principles and Policies 

To be a democracy at some point assumes a set of principles and policies on how we hold elections and vote. Ones we share as a nation, not different from state to state. We carry the legacy and burden of starting with few models for governance and a distrust of being one nation, in a country riven by slavery, where a fraction of the populace even had the right to vote.  While much was done by our founders and later by constitutional amendments to assert principles and policies of an advanced democracy.

The foundation are principles, generally seen as -
- Free and fair elections open to all citizens, based on the principle of one person one vote
- Majority rule balanced by minority rights
- Political competition and choice, where as much as possible, voters have their voice and count towards representation.
- Voting rights embedded in its constitution and statues - best suited to be adjudicated as much as possible by non-partisan-election administration and courts.

The building blocks are standard policies or laws for how we hold elections and vote that shared by all of its states for national and state elections. Fortunately, though it doesn’t always feel like it, for elections many standard policies are already used in many states, and supported by a majority of citizens. 

Here are this website’s top ten policies for what should be standard. Why these?  They are:
- Already used or there are current efforts to adopt them.
- Popular and have majority support wherever they are used
- Time-tested and refined in many states and localities, our “laboratory of democracy” as well as other advanced democracies
- An essential part of building and restoring trust in government and elections necessary to make democracy
- The ten are divided into two parts:  Five that make it easier not harder to register and vote, and give that increase the kind of electoral competition and voter choice a democracy should have that also help mitigate polarization and voter cynicism.
