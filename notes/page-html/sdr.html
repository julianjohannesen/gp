<p>In every national election several million voters are unable to vote due to problem with their voter registration.</p>

<p>One group are young voters, first-time voters, or those that have moved recently that miss their state’s deadline to register. Deadlines set weeks in advance of the election before Leaving many voters that don’t decide to vote until days before the election </p>

<p>A larger group are already registered voters turned away due to by a fixable error in their registration or incorrectly purged from the file. Among millions of new or updated registrations, mistakes are inevitably made by a clerk, third party registration drive, government agency, or the voter. Purges done to clean the state voter rolls can accidentally remove voters whose registration is valid. </p>

<h2>How it Works</h2>

<p>Same day registration, also known as Election Day registration, is a time-tested policy of First implemented by Maine, Minnesota, and Wisconsin in the 1970s. It allows voters with valid ID and proof of residency to register or update their registration when they vote on Election Day or during the early voting period Today there is no reason any state should let a fixable registration issue prevent citizens of voting age from voting.</p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>
<ul>
    <li>No voter is turned away by fixable voter registration issues. Voters still have a chance to register or correct a mistake in a previous registration when they vote. This is especially beneficial for first-time voters.</li>
    
    <li>It Increases accuracy of registration rolls. Unlike registrations mailed in or done online, same day registrations are done in person by trained election officials.</li>
    
    <li>Saves the added cost of and uncertainty of using provisional ballots now used for voters not properly on the list.</li>
    
    <li>This voter friendly policy has long been cited in political science research as likely to increase voter turnout by three to seven percentage points once implemented, even after controlling for other factors.</li>
</ul>
