    After ending my first job out of college as a tax preparer for H&R Block, a call from my mother about a youth-run foundation to support activism in San Francisco sparked the idea of organizing my peers to try the same in Boston.
</p>
<p>
    I had learned something about organizing from my activist mom who on most days could be found at her desk planning events or raising money for her favorite causes and candidates. I’d also picked up some organizing principles volunteering evenings after a day of H$R Block at a free tax clinic sponsored by Chelsea Fair Share. Fair Share’s leaders, Mark and Barbara Splain, taught me the value offering a service as part of earning trust and providing a chance to meet people who might join your cause. In their case an organization to build power among Chelsea’s low-income residents. It was a lesson I took with me for the rest of my career.

    Having grown up more as a volunteer than a leader of campaigns, my first organizing project was the Haymarket People’s Fund. I started out with advice from local faith programs that made grants to community empowerment projects. Their unique approach included actively engaging members of the community in awarding the grants. At that time, I was studying for a master’s degree in American Studies at Goddard College. My final paper became a blueprint for creating a foundation. The Goddard course also inspired the its name, one that mixed the activist history I’d learned about the Haymarket Chicago protest for the eight-hour workday and Boston’s iconic 300-year-old Haymarket food market.

    I followed the plan I created with my course instructor Steve Miller. First to explore how Boston foundations of the era worked, from the family foundations of the Cabot and Saltonstalls to the liberal churches and the social justice collaborative Resist. Then to meet with groups they suggested to explore the community organizing around Boston and eventually all of New England. All this became possible with my first hire, the wise and spirted Janet Axelrod and first full-time volunteer – my look alike twin to the outside world, David Crocker, assumed go to be heir to the “Betty Crocker” fortune, the made up brand of, Pillsbury’s competitor in the flour business.

<p>
    Haymarket and the other alternative community funds that would form across the country sought to create a new generation of donors to support social change philanthropy. Under the banner of “Change not Charity,” we looked to invest in local organizations addressing the root causes of problems and taking steps towards more systemic and lasting solutions for the issues of the day. We hoped that our grants would give these local nonprofits the visibility and credibility that often results from association with the more established foundations. 
</p>
<p>
    Among those with inherited wealth that came of age in the social movements of the ’60s and ’70s, there was interest in funding those movements—but given the desire of many to remain anonymous, the challenge was to find them. I remembered the strategy of first offering a service, and found success in organizing gatherings for people with family wealth, providing a safe environment to discuss the personal issues related to coming into such wealth, including the impact on relationships, concerns about where their money came from, and how to have a conversation with their families or financial gatekeepers about using it to support activism.
</p>
<p>
    Haymarket held its first local donor meetings in 1974 in partnership with the American Friends Service Committee. The Quaker network’s own donors had also asked for a personal retreat like this, with the assurances that the meeting would be private and free of fundraising. National gatherings began when our mentor, David Hunter of the Stern Family Fund, convened the donors he advised. Over time, the private meetings grew and would come to include activist leaders and guests who could offer their perspectives on social impact grantmaking. Through our formative years, we sponsored similar workshops and retreats—locally and nationally—that generated like-minded initiatives supporting a national trend towards social change grantmaking.

<p>
    Along with the change in the types of grants came a shift in decision-making power. We broke from the private trustee model of grantmaking, where grants were approved by a board of family members or related legal and financial professionals, administered by a family office, opting instead for funding boards that would reflect the issues and communities where the grants were being made. It seemed more effective to have local leaders with grassroots organizing experience lead the process, and more in line with our values to have the process itself be an extension of community empowerment.
</p>
<p>
    Haymarket’s founding board included activists like clerical worker Karen Nussbaum, who founded the organization 9to5, later made famous by the movie of the same name and Dolly Parton song; Walter Porter, Chair of the Boston association for minority firefighters; Robert Zevin, a lifelong activist and pioneer in the field of socially responsible investing; and Ann Froines, an advocate for women leaders. This model gave activists the opportunity to be grant makers Other public foundations with a similar mission soon adopted this approach.

        In another break with traditional philanthropy, we went public. Because we were new and had to find new donors to join in our cause, we turned to marketing and outreach. In lieu of TV ads and the Internet, we gained recognition by having a presence at foundation gatherings, as well as publishing Robin Hood Was Right, inspired and edited by author Adam Hochschild. The book, published in 1977, featured our funds and attracted a national audience with appearances on the Oprah Winfrey and Phil Donahue shows and coverage from the New York Times to Parade magazine, Esquire, and The Wall Street Journal, and more.

    In the wake of the publicity, young donors started 15 similar community foundations in areas like Atlanta, New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, and one in Los Angeles, Liberty Hill Foundation, founded by my sister Sarah Pillsbury. As we grew, it became clear that we would benefit from an association. Therefore, we created a national consortium called the Funding Exchange to support the growth of the local funds and to advance the conversation with other foundations around social change philanthropy.

<p>
    This is not the history of a single foundation. It is the story of many similar efforts that built a movement to reshape philanthropy and create a community of foundations that shared a common social justice mission. Together we promoted the benefits of strategic grantmaking that sought to advance, over time, longer-term systemic approaches to the issues of the day.
