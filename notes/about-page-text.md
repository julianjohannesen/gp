## Born a brand name

I was in born the son of Minnesotans George Sturgis Pillsbury and Sally Lucille (Whitney) Pillsbury in 1949, entering the world with a brand name passed down by my great grandfather Charles A. Pillsbury and his uncle, John S. Pillsbury. John was the first to leave the family homestead of Sutton New Hampshire. He found opportunity in a hardware store and later a flour mill in what would become Minneapolis. In 1855 John traveled to San Francisco, but backtracked to visit the more familiar settlement of Saint Anthony Falls along the Mississippi River. It reminded him of New Hampshire&#39;s Merrimack River he left behind.

Once the hardware store was up and running, he encouraged my grandfather Charles, who had studied the mills of Montreal to join him. His nephew&#39;s assignment was to start and manage what became the first Pillsbury mill. Enduring any number of challenges of the 19th century the from fires to finance and working with the belief that that the company&#39;s future depended on the health and education of its employees, it found its way. What was the originally the A-Mill is still marked by its landmark sign in neon lights on the skyline of Minneapolis.

Growing up their legacy there was no hiding from the brand and all that came with it. This became more true when the Pillsbury company adopted the [Dough Boy](https://www.pillsbury.com/doughboy) as it&#39;s mascot. left me with more than my share of &quot;are you related&quot; at the check-out counter and Dough Boy pokes and jokes.

Along with its eventual success in Minnesota came with the expectation of civic and community engagement, built on the values they brought with them from their life in New Hampshire and ancestors before. Values I was taught by my family and carried that into my career in philanthropy and voter engagement - starting with a grant making foundation for people of my generation to support social action and community organizing of the era. It was no surprise my ventures into philanthropy soon came with the nickname the Dough Boy.

My other brand were my parents, George and Sally Pillsbury. In their 56-year marriage, they were hard to miss at any venue or gathering for community service or on the campaign trail as lifelong political and civic activists. Save two years in New York, they lived and devoted their whole 90+ years in Minnesota.

My father ([1922-2012](https://www.startribune.com/obituaries/detail/13635262/)), was literally born in his parent&#39;s house west Minneapolis on Lake Minnetonka. A graduate of Yale University and a U.S. Marine, he was the last in the family to work for the Pillsbury company, later serving 12 years in the Minnesota State Senate.

My mother ([1924-2018](https://www.startribune.com/obituaries/detail/0000242819/)), grew up in St. Cloud, a small city northwest of the Twin Cities. Having moved with her family to Lake Minnetonka where my father grew up, she graduated Smith College. She made her name in community service and politics.

They both strived at every opportunity to hold up the moderate Lincoln wing of the Republican party. Well into their 80&#39;s at a time my father was [banned](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2010/12/04/republican-central-committee) by the state party for supporting an Independent candidate.

**Early years**

My first memory in politics was joining my mother at the 1958 Minnesota Republican convention where teen entertainment was a hula hoop contest. Embarrassing but fun. It was the start of a steady flow of state and county conventions and campaigns run out of our basement or featured at the political booths of the state fair.

I joined her at the 1964 GOP national convention in San Francisco on behalf of moderate Pennsylvania Governor Bill Scranton against Barry Goldwater. A preview of the break from its Lincoln roots. Then in 1968, in the wake of the explosive protests at Chicago&#39;s Democratic Convention, in Miami for =New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller against Richard Nixon. There with a busload of young Republicans, including my sister Sarah. In distress of the party&#39;s choice, on our bus ride home our youth group issued a press release picked up (to our parent&#39;s surprise) by the local papers endorsing the Democratic nominee, Senator Hubert Humphrey (MN)

I still had opportunities to work and support for Republican moderates. Looking back, it was when I first time I believed as a voter we needed more than two parties to choose from, something my parents had already acted as in their support of independent candidates, joining me later in life in support of a voting method that would allow this without fear of splitting the vote and election the person you most wanted to lose

### College – 1968 - 2002

Before 1968 I saw politics only as what candidate to work for in the next election. This changed after a year working in Australia (1967-68) watching the issues of race and war tear apart the country I would come home to. This would accelerate months later when moving to the diverse working-class city of New Haven to enter college and avoid the draft at Yale. As it was, I was more engaged by what the New Haven Black Panthers were doing and the anti-war protests. I didn&#39;t give up contesting elections, joining my brother to canvass for the peace campaign of New York&#39;s Al Lowenstein. I signed onto join the reform mayoral campaign to unseat New Haven&#39;s party machine.

At the same time, I made my first ever political donation. In a short-lived plan for anonymity, l$200 in cash left at the office at the office of the Black Panthers for their free breakfast and health programs and, community education. I let them have my car to help residents visit family members in prison. My volunteer work earned me a substantial FBI file informed by the New Haven police tapping my dorm room phone. A few years later a letter arrived with a $1,000 check from a class action suit I signed onto against the New Haven PD.

I had some memorable college classes, but maybe because the family I grew up with, I learned the most from what happened outside them. My friendship with the panther leaders and the lessons in personal relations across different backgrounds. Time volunteering in the New Haven schools and a semester spent working in the Bancroft public school in Boston&#39;s South End. Two weeks on a picket line with the dining hall and janitorial workers. Yale going co-ed in my sophomore year (I&#39;d been at boys&#39; schools since 3rd grade). In 1969 outnumbered by eight to one, 455 women brought feminism to campus, interrupting a men&#39;s club of 265 years.

My first job after college was doing a season of tax preparation for H&amp;R Block. I had graduated a semester late, and had taken their tax prep course in the fall to so I had a job in January when I moved northeast to Cambridge. In my Central Square office, I had a chance to learn the ins and outs of deductions and help area residents like presidential biographer [Doris Kearns Goodwin](https://doriskearnsgoodwin.com/) and future author, [Joe Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Klein), then a columnist for city&#39;s alternative weekly, _The Real Paper._ In the evenings I volunteered at a free tax clinic for low-income residents in sponsored by Fair Share, a community group in neighboring Chelsea.

### Haymarket Foundation

As the tax season wound down and I wondered what was next,

I got a timely call from my mother. She had just met someone my age at the national meeting of the Council of Foundations, held this year in Minneapolis. As was her nature, she introduced herself to the youngest person there, the one with the pony tail and sneakers. Obie Benz, a Sunbeam bread heir, had started the Vanguard Foundation in San Francisco as a way for young people with inherited wealth, to support social change initiatives in the Bay area. Urged on by my college friend, Lynn Rosengarten, I decided to give it a try in Boston. We traveled west to meet Obie and his volunteer Anne Hess. Annie had experience from a family foundation, the Stern Family Fund. At the time it was one of the few national foundations to focus on supporting activism. Its director [David Hunter](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/30/nyregion/david-hunter-84-innovator-in-matching-philanthropies.html) would be invaluable in helping us get started.

New to Boston and with less money than people expected from my last name, I had to find others like myself to join in. In time or just in time they did and the Haymarket Foundation started in Harvard Square. It offered an opportunity for 1960&#39;s and 70&#39;s influenced young donors in New England to support organizing and community empowerment. Empowerment included sharing the power to make grants with experienced local leaders. Haymarket also gave its donors, many who remained anonymous, a chance to meet with others like themselves to discuss personal issues related to coming into inherited wealth and living out the values that drew them to Haymarket in the first place.

### Funding Exchange

We first reached national audience publishing a book called [_Robin Hood Was Right_](https://www.abebooks.com/9780960197415/Robin-Hood-right-guide-giving-0960197419/plp), a gift giving guide to funding social change. Talk show hosts Phil Donahue and Oprah Winfrey invited us on to talk about the book - and, in a friendly way, ask questions like why we were supporting causes that could well reduce our wealth advantage?

In the wake of the publicity, young donors started similar community foundations started in Atlanta, New York, Chicago, Minneapolis and more. We created national consortium called the Funding Exchange to support their growth engage other foundations in a conversation about social change philanthropy and more diversity on their boards.

### The Film Fund

Our foundations lacked the expertise to fund the media arts, like documentary films that could dramatize the issues we addressed. In response, my Haymarket co-founder David Crocker and I joined producer Miles Mogulescu to create The Film Fund, as a vehicle to support and give visibility to social issue documentaries such as ones we&#39;d invested in individually: 1976 Oscar-winning, [Harlan County USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_County,_USA) by and 1977 Oscar nominee [Union Maids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Maids).

We recruited a panel of experienced filmmakers like Barbara Kopple and Julia Reichert, the directors of the above films, and renowned cinematographer Haskell Wexler with the expertise to evaluate promising documentaries already in production in need of a boost or finishing costs. The Film Fund had a ten-year life, contributing with others to the emergence of independent documentary film we see today.

By the 1990s, the nonprofit and philanthropic sector had grown exponentially. Many more traditional community and private foundations and new ones similar to ours had incorporated a more systemic approach to social issues and support for advocacy and community building that came with that. At the same time, it became more evident that progress on any issue depended on a democracy and government that worked and had the trust and participation of its citizens. That brought me back to my family roots in good government and elections.

In 1994 a mid-career year program at the Harvard Kennedy School gave me an opportunity to explore best practices of election democracy among the states and in countries similar to ours. On graduation, I took a job with the Commonwealth Coalition, a network of advocacy groups working to elect reform candidates to the state legislature. The Commonwealth Coalition also had two democracy programs, Voter Power and Money and Politics. I was hired to direct the latter and help out with Voter Power.

### Boston Vote – MassVOTE

As voter turnout in Boston hit rock bottom, local nonprofit leaders approached us to see if their community-based organizations could the people they serve on a daily basis register and vote. As long as voter participation in their neighborhoods remained low, they&#39;d continue to be overlooked by campaigns and elected officials.

Together we started Boston Vote to train nonprofits on what they could do on a non-partisan basis to encourage voting and better understand its broader benefits to their mission and people they served. It Boston Vote would become MassVOTE and also worked with local election officers and state officials on improving voter access and education. Along the way It won some key voting rights victories like – one the led the high-profile resignation of a House Speaker who tried to personally gerrymander Boston&#39;s black community and dilute their vote.

### Nonprofit VOTE

In 2004, we discovered the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits ran a program similar to MassVOTE. Its advocacy director, Marcia Avner, contacted us about a collaboration to share our models with other states. Nonprofit associations in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, Louisiana, Maine, were some of the earliest to join what would become the Nonprofit VOTE. With the help of the National Council of Nonprofits, it initially focused on training and resourcing other state nonprofit conveners to make voter engagement part of their programing with their members.

Through its website, communications, and national partnerships, it reached a 50-state audience for its nonpartisan resources and trainings to help nonprofits integrate voter engagement into their ongoing activities and services.

Some of the early national partnerships were with nonprofit convenors like the National Council of Nonprofits, Independent Sector, and United Way, and networks like the National Association of Community Health Centers, Goodwill Industries, Feeding America, and [Alliance for Strong Families and Communities](https://www.alliance1.org/web/about/web/about-us.aspx).

Nonprofit VOTE soon became the official partner for the nonprofit sector for the National Association of Secretaries of State. With their support, in 2012 it was a co-founder of National Voter Registration Day. Today as its manager, National Voter Registration Day has become an annual nonpartisan civic holiday celebrating our democracy. First observed in 2012, it has quickly gained momentum ever since. Nearly 4.5 million voters have registered to vote on the holiday to date.
