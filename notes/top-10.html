      </p>
      <p>
        Every state should have robust options to vote by mail, early-in person
        or on Election Day. The most effective is to send every registered voter
        a mail ballot 2-3 weeks before the election with convenient options to
        return the ballot by mail, drop box, or at vote center on Election Day.
        See how it works in Colorado

      <p>
        Restore the vote for all people released from prison, including those on
        probation and parole. Ensure all 50 states have the same standard for
        who is eligible to vote in state and federal elections. (Withholding the
        vote post-prison serves no public purpose and only undercuts
        rehabilitation and better citizenship.)

        All states create non-partisan redistricting commissions and other
